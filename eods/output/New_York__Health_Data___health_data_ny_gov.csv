The view defaults to a high-level map of the Eastern United States with the entire HIVQUAL data set represented by a large red dot over New York State.  Clicking repeatedly on this dot zooms the view into New York, and as the view narrows the single dot is replaced by multiple dots that represent smaller clusters of sites.  (Red dots represent aggregated samples of 1000 or more; orange dots represent 100 to 999 patients; and yellow dots represent up to 99 patients).
Each of these dots may be clicked in turn, which zooms the view into that area.  Data are eventually displayed at the level of individual clinics, which are represented by small blue dots.  Clicking on any of these generates a ""flyout"" text box that contains the program's name, its facility type, and the name, score and performance quintile for the current indicator.  Clicking ""view details for this row"" will display the entire data point in a table view below the map, including the street address for the clinic.
While it is possible to scroll through the performance for each indicator by clicking repeatedly on the ""Next"" link in the flyout, it will usually be more convenient to filter the map data to focus on a particular indicator.  This can be done by typing a portion of the indicator name in the ""Indicator Name contains"" text box to the right of the map and then checking the box just to the left of that field.  For example, filtering on ""domestic"" will limit the display to the ""Domestic violence screening"" indicator.

Pediatric (AHRQ PDI) for Medicaid enrollees beginning in 2011.
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. Both the Urinary Tract Infection and Gastroenteritis PDIs include admissions for patients aged 3 months through 17 years.  The asthma PDI includes admissions for patients aged 2 through 17 years.  Eligible admissions for the Diabetes Short-term Complications PDI includes admissions for patients aged 6 through 17 years.
The rates were calculated using Medicaid inpatient hospital data for the numerator and Medicaid enrollment in the county or zip code for the denominator.  
The observed counts and rates, expected counts and rates, risk-adjusted rates and the difference between the number of observed and expected PDI hospitalizations for each AHRQ PDI are presented by either resident county (including a statewide total) or resident zip code (including a statewide total).

The chart gives an indication of the ability of the HNP environmental intervention to decrease the prevalence of mice in the home.  The HNP pest control intervention involves providing products (such as traps and cleaning supplies) and educating residents about removing harborage and food for pests by storing garbage appropriately, cleaning, and repairing holes that give mice entry into the home.  In some cases, the HNP contacts local code enforcement or the landlord.
We can see that the initial visit percentages vary substantially across the across counties, which could reflect differing geography, urban versus rural target areas, and the quality of the housing stock.  Except for one county, the homes that were selected for a revisit have a lower percentage with mice homes that had an initial visit, indicating an overall reduction in the percentage of homes with mice after the HNP intervention, although mice were not eradicated from all the homes.  Oneida and Cortland Counties show no mice in the revisited homes, which could be an indication of success of the intervention and/or the selection of homes to revisit.  For Westchester County, it is possible that the homes that the revisited homes were the worst and, therefore, had a higher percentage.

Health,"Each dwelling visited by the HNP is classified into one of three periods based on the year it was built: before 1950 (?pre-1950?), built 1950-1978, or built after 1978.  These periods relate to the general age of the housing.  Older housing can present health and safety hazards to their residents.  In addition, these groupings coincide with the presence of lead in paint, a health hazard for young children.
For dwellings visited by the Clinton County HNP, this chart displays the percent of homes built in each period by funding cycle.  For example, the first set of bars shows the percent of dwellings that were built before 1950 during each of the 3 funding cycles.  We can see that Clinton County has increased the percent of the oldest homes from about 10% in the first funding cycle to almost 30% during the current funding cycle.  Looking at the orange bars, we see that during the current funding cycle, Clinton County?s HNP has visited about the same percentage of homes built in each time period.

The chart gives an indication of the ability of the HNP?s smoking intervention (referrals and education) to decrease the prevalence of smoking in the home.  The initial visit percentages range across counties from about 8% to almost 60%.  There was a substantial reduction in Albany County, but most counties are essentially unchanged which may indicate the difficulty in changing people?s smoking habits.  Three counties show no homes with smokers at the revisit, but these are newly funded counties that have conducted very few revisits to date.

These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. Both the Urinary Tract Infection and Gastroenteritis PDIs include admissions for patients aged 3 months through 17 years.  The asthma PDI includes admissions for patients aged 2 through 17 years.  Eligible admissions for the Diabetes Short-term Complications PDI includes admissions for patients aged 6 through 17 years.
The rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information.  
The observed, expected, risk-adjusted rates, and difference in rates, for each AHRQ PDI are presented by either resident county (including a statewide total). To view the data presented by resident zip code (including a statewide tota), go to:  https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Prevention-Quality-Indicators-P/2xc5-n3zd.

Health,"This chart shows Gamma Radiation measurements for the West Valley site compared to background measurements collected.  Note that the results for the ""Fence Line at Waste Area"" location are elevated compared to other locations.  Elevated radiation levels are expected at this monitoring location due to its proximity to a High Level Radioactive Waste Storage Facility.  This is an on-site location. Access to this location is controlled by the site operator.  Based on historical data and changes in site activities, monitoring at several locations was discontinued in July 2012 and going forward.  Present locations monitored, in addition to the ""Fence Line at Waste Area,"" are ""Rock Spring Road"" and ""Springville-Erie County.""  Monitoring for this location was done in 1995 only.

These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. 
The observed rate for Low Birth Weight is presented by resident county (including a statewide total). The observed rate for low birth weight by resident zip code (including a statewide total) can be found here: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Medicaid-Inpatient-Prevention-Quality-Indicators-P/vk5f-rgqm/.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. All PQIs apply only to adult populations (over the age of 18 years). The rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information. The observed rates and expected rates for each AHRQ PQI is presented by either resident county (including a statewide total) or resident zip code (including a statewide total).

This dataset is one of two datasets that contain observed and expected rates for Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators ? Adult (AHRQ PQI) beginning in 2009. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) are a set of population based measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. All PQIs apply only to adult populations (over the age of 18 years). The rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information. The observed rates and expected rates for each AHRQ PQI is presented by either resident county (including a statewide total) or resident zip code (including a statewide total).

Health,"The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.
