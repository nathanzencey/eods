"Housing, Land Use, and Blight","FEMA, in coordination with GOHSEP, the City, the State Historic Preservation Office and many other consulting parties, resolved the adverse effect to historic properties resulting from FEMA-funded demolition of residential structures through execution and implementation of the Orleans Demolition Secondary Programmatic Agreement. As one of the measures designed to offset this adverse effect, FEMA professionally surveyed 7 of New Orleans? National Register listed historic districts. FEMA also surveyed tens of thousands of properties slated for demolition. In 2011, FEMA surveyed 8 additional districts as a result of a similar statewide agreement offsetting FEMA-funded elevations of residences. These are the results of the surveys, including historical attributes of the surveyed structures, and several photos of each (linked in the attribute table). The data for all of these properties and ownership of this data was handed over to the City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana. The intent, building off of the discussions during consultation for both of these programmatic agreements and the spirit of the National Historic Preservation Act which encourages all treatment measures to offset adverse to historic properties, is that the City (and State) use this data for public benefit.
