This dataset provides data on the number of households, recipients and cash assistance provided through the Food Assistance Program participation by month and county starting in January 2011 and updated monthly.
Beginning January 2017, the method used to identify households is based on the following:
1.  If one or more individuals receiving Food Assistance also receives  FIP, the household is categorized as FA/FIP.
2.  If no one receives FIP, but at least one individual also receives Medical Assistance, the household is categorized as FA/Medical Assistance.
3.  If no one receives FIP or Medical Assistance, but at least one individual receives Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa or hawk-i benefits, the household is categorized as FA/hawk-i.
4.  If no one receives FIP, Medical Assistance or  hawk-i , the household is categorized as FA Only.
Changes have also been made to reflect more accurate identification of individuals.  The same categories from above are used in identifying an individual's circumstances.  Previously, the household category was assigned to all individuals of the Food Assistance household, regardless of individual status.  This change in how individuals are categorized provides a more accurate count of individual categories.
Timing of when the report is run also changed starting January 2017.  Reports were previously ran on the 1st, but changed to the 17th to better capture Food Assistance households that received benefits for the prior month.

Transportation & Utilities,"Crash history by county. Identifies number of crashes and injuries on a county by county basis going back to 2001. The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.?For more detail, please see: http://www.iowadot.gov/crashanalysis/top200.htm",County Traffic Crash Statistics (SICL),"['crash analysis', 'iowa department of transportation', 'iowa dot', 'safety', 'intersection']",Map,189.0,0.016212043232115284

Transportation & Utilities,"This dataset presents existing and candidate park and ride lots in the state of Iowa, represented in a point feature.  Point features were created using aerial imagery.
The Iowa Department of Transportation?s park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT?s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.
As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",Statewide Park and Ride System,"['iowa department of transportation', 'iowa dot', 'commuting', 'commute', 'statewide']",Map,185.0,0.015868931206038772

The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. 
The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.?For more detail, please see: http://www.iowadot.gov/crashanalysis/top200.htm

This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.?For more detail, please see: http://www.iowadot.gov/crashanalysis/top200.htm

The storm water permits database tracks wastewater permits for NPDES General permits #1-3.  General NPDES Permits allow the DNR to allocate resources in an efficient manner to provide more timely permit coverage.  For example, many facilities that have common elements may be covered under a general permit without expending the time and money necessary to issue individual permits to each facility.  In addition, using a general permit ensures consistency of permit conditions for similar facilities.  General permit #1 covers storm water discharge associated with industrial activity.

Transportation & Utilities,"This map contains all access priority layers, which can be turned on or off in the legend (under Data Layers). Descriptions are below.
The efficiency and safety of a highway depends largely on the amount and character of interruptions to the movement of traffic. The primary cause of these interruptions is vehicular movements to and from business, residences and other developments along the highway. Regulation and overall control of highway access are necessary to provide efficient and safe highway operation and to utilize the full potential of the highway investment. Accordingly, the Iowa DOT has established an access management policy to control access to the Primary Highway System. When right-of-way was obtained for the establishment of the primary highway system, the Iowa Department of Transportation obtained access rights that allow the DOT to restrict direct access to the primary highway. As a result, the DOT has established a functional hierarchy to prioritize the primary highway system. Priority levels are explained below.
Access Priority Level 1 is for four-lane freeways with access allowed only at interchanges - no direct accesses allowed.?
Priority Level 2 is for four-lane rural highways with access at interchanges and selected at-grade locations - 1/2 mile minimum, 1 mile preferred spacing.?
Priority Level 3 is for four-lane rural highways with access at interchanges and selected at-grade locations - 1,000 foot minimum, 1/4 mile preferred spacing.
Priority Level 4 is for two-lane rural highways with fewer limitations on access - 600/300 foot minimum between accesses.?
Other Priority is for accesses granted on a case-by-case basis depending on safety and need. It is not actively managed (formerly 5, 6, and 0).

This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year.

To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list.

1. Purpose.  It is the purpose of this section to enhance opportunities for the development and diversification of the state?s economy through the identification and improvement of a network of commercial and industrial highways.  The network shall consist of interconnected routes which provide long distance route continuity.  The purpose of this highway network shall be to improve the flow of commerce; to make travel more convenient, safe, and efficient; and to better connect Iowa with regional, national, and international markets.  The commission shall concentrate a major portion of its annual construction budget on this network of commercial and industrial highways.  In order to ensure the greatest possible availability of funds for the improvement of the network, primary highway funds shall not be spent beyond continuing maintenance for improvements to route segments that will be bypassed by the relocation of portions of the commercial and industrial highway network.

2. Network selection.
a. The commission shall identify, within the primary road system, a network of commercial and industrial highways.  The commission shall consider all of the following factors in the identification of this network:
i. The connection by the most direct routes feasible of major urban areas and regions of the state to each other and to the national system of interstate and defense highways and priority routes in adjacent states.
ii. The existence of high volumes of total traffic and commercial traffic.
iii. Long distance traffic movements.
iv. Area coverage and balance of spacing with service to major growth centers within the state.
v. Metropolitan area bypasses consistent with metropolitan or regional area plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials.
b. The network of commercial and industrial highways shall not exceed two thousand  six hundred miles including municipal extensions of these highways.

3. Standards.  The department shall establish standards pertaining to the specific location, design, and access control for each segment of the commercial and industrial highways.

4. Network development.  In establishing priorities for improvement projects, the department shall take into consideration the following additional criteria:  urban area bypasses that improve urban or regional accessibility or improve corridor travel; projects consistent with regional or metropolitan transportation plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials; and the willingness of local officials to provide financial or other assistance for the development of projects.

Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2012 Integrated Report.  Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"".
New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",Impaired Lakes 2012,"['impaired list', 'lakes', 'waterbodies', 'water quality']",Map,26.0,0.002230228169497341

Environment,"This dataset contains line work representing streams and rivers listed as ""impaired"" in Iowa's 2012 Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment and the 303(d) Impaired Waters Report. Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2012 Integrated Report.
Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"".
New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",Impaired Streams 2012,"['impaired list', 'rivers', 'streams', 'water quality']",Map,20.0,0.0017155601303825698

Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"".
New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",Impaired Streams 2014,"['impaired list', 'rivers', 'streams', 'water quality']",Map,14.0,0.001200892091267799

Environment,"This dataset represents the centroids of lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands that were listed as ""impaired"" in Iowa's 2014 Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment and the 303(d) Impaired Waters Report. Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2012 Integrated Report.  Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"".
New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",Impaired Lakes 2014,"['impaired list', 'lakes', 'waterbodies', 'water quality']",Map,8.0,0.0006862240521530279
