The study area for this project includes all or portions of the following counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Denver, Douglas, Weld, Broomfield, and Boulder. Study area boundaries were defined to encompass the Denver Regional 2035 Urban Growth boundary, using the MPO boundary to the east and the mountain backdrop to the west. A fundamental milestone for this project was to create an up-to-date inventory of publicly accessible parks, green space, and trails.

Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.
Erosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990).

Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S.

Anyone with a current hunting/fishing license, or boat, snowmobile, ATV registration is already covered by the fund.
The card is not insurance and does not reimburse individuals nor does it pay for medical transport. Medical transport includes helicopter flights or ground ambulance.

Erosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990).

Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S.

Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.
Erosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S.

Water,"Livestock water tanks are covered under the ""Livestock Water Tank Act of Colorado"" sections 35-49-101 to 35-49-116, C.R.S. These structures include all reservoirs built after April 17, 1941, on watercourses which the state engineer has determined to be ""normally dry"" and having a capacity of not more than ten acre-feet and a vertical height not exceeding fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway. Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.
Erosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S. (1990). Note: The structure can be larger than specified under section 37-87-122, however, it then will be evaluated and must be constructed pursuant to section 37-87-105.",Teller County LSWTs,"['reservoir', 'dam safety', 'livestock water tank erosion control']",Filtered View,73.0,0.0025376299231758613

Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.
Erosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S. (1990).

These four-year estimates (2012-2015) have been produced for each census tract in the State of Colorado based on modeled survey data collected in the Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and incorporating population, race, gender, and age estimates for each census tract from the American Community Survey.  CDPHE's Community Level Estimates are output from statistical models used to generate health condition and risk behavior estimates for smaller geographies than traditional surveillance systems report. The estimates are produced using a multilevel model that incorporates individual Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey responses in addition to socio-demographic and contextual information about each census tract from the U.S. Census (American Community Survey). The individual survey responses related to a health condition or risk behavior from the Colorado BRFSS are nested within geographic boundaries (counties) where both individual characteristics (demographic) as well as sociodemographic characteristics can be used to model the probability of having a health condition or risk behavior at the census tract geography.",CDPHE Composite Community Level Estimates (Census Tracts),"['community level estimates', 'risk behavior', 'health', 'gis', 'colorado']",External Link,4.0,0.00013904821496854035
