See Attachments section below for a data dictionary and list of metric definitions.
**Please note that CityScore captures a data snapshot once every weekday. Source systems are constantly updating, and these updates can include revisions to existing data that could affect CityScore's calculations. The most recent records are always the most accurate.
In addition, you may notice null values in the data set, which indicate that CityScore has no data for a given time period. This most often occurs when a particular data source is updated on a different schedule than CityScore's calculations. We are currently working to adjust our process to allow CityScore to capture data every day, including weekends, as well as to retroactively generate values for fields created after the initial CityScore launch in January.**",CityScore Summary,"['performance management', 'cityscore']",Dataset,257.0,3.3122927561575134e-05
