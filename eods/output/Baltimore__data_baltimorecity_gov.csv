The Bicycle Master Plan was developed by the Department of Planning in 2006. With the implementation of the Bicycle Master Plan, more bike facilities are appearing on city streets. There are many different types of bike facilities. Bike Lane: an area designated for bike travel only. The bike lane is a 5??_?? wide lane with a bike symbol indicating that only bikes should use that lane, Sharrow: A roadway which is shared by bikes and automobiles. Cars should treat bikes as vehicles in the lane and pass when it is safe to do so, Signed Route: A roadway with no pavement markings, signed routes are used on low-traffic volume streets where cyclists can ??_??_??_take the lane??_??. Cars should pass bikes when it is safe to do so. Signed routes typically have mileage and destination markers with route adjustments along the way, Floating Bike Lane: Used along off-peak temporary parking, floating bike lanes adjust to the presence of parked cars. If parked cars are not present, cyclists occupy the 5??_?? bike lane along the curb. When parked cars are present, the cyclist travels in the designated area between the parked cars and vehicular travel lanes, Share The Road: When space does not exist for bike lanes, ??_??_??_SHARE THE ROAD??_?? signs are installed to remind motorists that cyclists may be present. Here cyclists are encouraged to use the shoulder of the road, or travel to the right while avoiding ??_??_??_door zones??_?? and roadside hazards, Shared Bus & Bike Lanes: On Pratt St, these lanes are only available to buses, bicycles and right turning vehicles",Bike Lanes,"['transportation', 'bike', 'bike lanes']",Dataset,1820.0,0.030047382410724605

Neighborhoods,"Baltimore City is home to many green spaces, parks, and waterways. Some of the more widely recognized locations include the Inner Harbor, Middle Branch, Druid Hill , Gwynns Falls and Herring Run Parks. City residents in particular value access to green spaces as a place to recreate, exercise and congregate, but the City??_??s green spaces serve a vital role in ensuring clean air and water for long term urbansustainability. Baltimore neighborhoods actively participate in increasing access to green spaces through tree planting and other watershed protection activities such as stream clean-ups. Urban living also enables residents the option to choose alternative means of transportation to reduce vehicle miles traveled by car. The City is already served by numerous modes of mass transit including MARC, metro, light rail, the Charm City Circulator, and bus lines. BNIA-JFI tracks eight indicators to measure the City??_??s urban environment and transit. These indicators are categorized into the following categories: air quality and hazardous waste; tree canopy, alternative transportation mode use; and travel time to work.",Urban Environment & Transit 2010,"['census', 'environment', 'transit']",Dataset,983.0,0.01622888841194631

Neighborhoods,"BNIA-JFI tracks twenty seven indicators for elementary, middle, and high school students in an effort to measure the educational performance and youth engagement in Baltimore City. These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department ofEducation due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data filesprovided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore directcomparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.",Education and Youth 2010,"['census', 'youth', 'education']",Dataset,816.0,0.013471793432500701

Neighborhoods,"Baltimore City is home to many green spaces, parks, and waterways. Some of the more widely recognized locations include the Inner Harbor, Middle Branch, Druid Hill , Gwynns Falls and Herring Run Parks. City residents in particular value access to green spaces as a place to recreate, exercise and congregate, but the City??_??s green spaces serve a vital role in ensuring clean air and water for long term urban sustainability. Baltimore neighborhoods actively participate in increasing access to green spaces through tree planting and other watershed protection activities such as stream clean-ups. Urban living also enables residents the option to choose alternative means of transportation to reduce vehicle miles traveled by car. The City is already served by numerous modes of mass transit including MARC, metro, light rail, the Charm City Circulator, and bus lines. BNIA-JFI tracks eight indicators to measure the City??_??s urban environment and transit. These indicators are categorized into the following categories: air quality and hazardous waste; tree canopy, alternative transportation mode use; and travel time to work.",Urban Environment & Transit 2010 -  Shape,"['transit', 'environment', 'census']",Map,759.0,0.012530749038318667

Neighborhoods,"BNIA-JFI tracks twenty seven indicators for elementary, middle, and high school students in an effort to measure the educational performance and youth engagement in Baltimore City. These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of Education due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files provided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore direct comparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.",Education and Youth (2010-2013),"['bnia', 'education']",Dataset,622.0,0.01026894058212676

Transportation,"BikeBaltimore is the Department of Transportation??_??s bike program.

The Bicycle Master Plan was developed by the Department of Planning in 2006. With the implementation of the Bicycle Master Plan, more bike facilities are appearing on city streets. There are many different types of bike facilities. Bike Lane: an area designated for bike travel only. The bike lane is a 5??_?? wide lane with a bike symbol indicating that only bikes should use that lane, Sharrow: A roadway which is shared by bikes and automobiles. Cars should treat bikes as vehicles in the lane and pass when it is safe to do so, Signed Route: A roadway with no pavement markings, signed routes are used on low-traffic volume streets where cyclists can ??_??_??_take the lane??_??. Cars should pass bikes when it is safe to do so. Signed routes typically have mileage and destination markers with route adjustments along the way, Floating Bike Lane: Used along off-peak temporary parking, floating bike lanes adjust to the presence of parked cars. If parked cars are not present, cyclists occupy the 5??_?? bike lane along the curb. When parked cars are present, the cyclist travels in the designated area between the parked cars and vehicular travel lanes, Share The Road: When space does not exist for bike lanes, ??_??_??_SHARE THE ROAD??_?? signs are installed to remind motorists that cyclists may be present. Here cyclists are encouraged to use the shoulder of the road, or travel to the right while avoiding ??_??_??_door zones??_?? and roadside hazards, Shared Bus & Bike Lanes: On Pratt St, these lanes are only available to buses, bicycles and right turning vehicles",Bike Lane + Signed Route,"['transportation', 'bike', 'bike lanes']",Filtered View,556.0,0.009179310230968615

The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. The SLOSH MOM data is utilized. MOM is the ""Maximum of Maximum or ""Meows Of Meows"".

The first is simply ??_??_??_shelter??_?? and the second is a more involved program that is typically a longer stay. Emergency Shelter: Any facility with overnight sleeping accommodations, the primary purpose of which is to provide temporary shelter for the homeless in general or for specific populations of homeless persons. The length of stay can range from one night up to as much as six months.

SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features.

Neighborhoods,"BNIA-JFI tracks twenty seven indicators for elementary, middle, and high school students in an effort to measure the educational performance and youth engagement in Baltimore City. These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of Education due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files provided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore direct comparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.",Education and Youth 2010 - Shape,"['education', 'youth', 'census']",Map,303.0,0.0050023938848623925

Geographic,"This file is generated as part of the Hazards Analysis within the Hurricane Evacuation Study for the Maryland Western Shore. Storm surge zones have been developed for category 1-4 hurricanes represented by the Saffir-Simpson Scale. The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. The SLOSH MOM data is utilized. MOM is the ""Maximum of Maximum or ""Meows Of Meows"". MOM output represents the highest water level or the ""worst case scenario"" for the entire Slosh basin.",Baltimore City Hurricane inundation zone,[],Map,288.0,0.004754750623235542

These indicators are grouped into the following categories: labor force participation and employment; educational attainment; commercial investment activity; and businesses and successful small businesses. Information for the City of Baltimore is now available on an annual basis from the American Community Survey (ACS), but community-level information is aggregated over 5-years of data collection. In Vital Signs 10, indicators were calculated using the 5-year average from the 2006-2010 ACS. Business data is purchased from InfoUSA and is available at the address level, which can be aggregated to the CSA level for Vital Signs. It is still important to note that the firm level data from InfoUSA is best to be analyzed at the City level since due to methodology issues, individual level firm data can be problematic to analyze.",Workforce & Economic Development 2010 - Shape,"['workforce', 'economic', 'business', 'small business', 'census']",Map,265.0,0.004375030955407704

Transportation,"BikeBaltimore is the Department of Transportation??_??s bike program. Managed by the Planning Section, BikeBaltimore includes anything bike related including implementing the Bicycle Master Plan, incorporating cycling in many transportation projects, installing bike racks and coordinating cycling events. The Bicycle Master Plan was developed by the Department of Planning in 2006. With the implementation of the Bicycle Master Plan, more bike facilities are appearing on city streets. There are many different types of bike facilities. Bike Lane: an area designated for bike travel only. The bike lane is a 5??_?? wide lane with a bike symbol indicating that only bikes should use that lane, Sharrow: A roadway which is shared by bikes and automobiles. Cars should treat bikes as vehicles in the lane and pass when it is safe to do so, Signed Route: A roadway with no pavement markings, signed routes are used on low-traffic volume streets where cyclists can ??_??_??_take the lane??_??. Cars should pass bikes when it is safe to do so. Signed routes typically have mileage and destination markers with route adjustments along the way, Floating Bike Lane: Used along off-peak temporary parking, floating bike lanes adjust to the presence of parked cars. If parked cars are not present, cyclists occupy the 5??_?? bike lane along the curb. When parked cars are present, the cyclist travels in the designated area between the parked cars and vehicular travel lanes, Share The Road: When space does not exist for bike lanes, ??_??_??_SHARE THE ROAD??_?? signs are installed to remind motorists that cyclists may be present. Here cyclists are encouraged to use the shoulder of the road, or travel to the right while avoiding ??_??_??_door zones??_?? and roadside hazards, Shared Bus & Bike Lanes: On Pratt St, these lanes are only available to buses, bicycles and right turning vehicles",Bike Boulevard,"['transportation', 'bike', 'bike lanes']",Filtered View,240.0,0.003962292186029618

Neighborhoods,"BNIA-JFI tracks twenty seven indicators for elementary, middle, and high school students in an effort to measure the educational performance and youth engagement in Baltimore City. These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of Education due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files provided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore direct comparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.",Education and Youth (2010-2013)  - Shape,"['education', 'bnia']",Map,144.0,0.002377375311617771
