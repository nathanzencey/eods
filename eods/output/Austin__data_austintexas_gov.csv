Financial,"City of Austin current budget fiscal year Operating Budget showing budget versus expenditures.  This budget is at the Fund, Department, Unit level.  This data set includes a build date and will be updated on a quarterly basis.  The data contained in this data set is for informational purposes. Certain Austin Energy budget items have been excluded as competitive matters under Texas Government Code Section 552.133 and City Council Resolution 20051201-002.
The comparison of actual expenditures to budget may appear inconsistent. That is because base wages for personnel are fully budgeted in the expense categories regular wages?full-time, regular wages?part-time or regular wages?civil service. The budget does not assume expenditure levels for the various leave categories, such as sick pay, vacation pay, or jury leave. However, actual expenses for various leave categories are recorded based on timesheet coding. The result is that actual expenditures for regular wages are spread across multiple expense categories while the budget is shown in one expense category.
Personnel savings is budgeted to account for the likely savings in personnel costs generated through attrition. However, the savings is realized in the expense categories regular wages?full-time, regular wages?part-time and regular wages?civil service. Therefore, the actual expenditures in the personnel savings expense category will always be zero.",Program Budget Operating Budget Vs Expense Raw Data,"['controller', 'budget documents', 'raw budget data', 'austin finance online', 'austin']",Dataset,2502.0,0.018272510169652444

Each year, the Public Works Street and Bridge Operations performs street preventative maintenance to over 700 street segments to help offset the cost of expensive road repairs. 
Why do we do this? Having scheduled preventative maintenance will help prolong the life of the streets by protecting the surface from the effects of aging, cracking, deterioration, and water infiltration. Additionally, prolonging the life of our city streets by using these methods saves taxpayer money by intervening before full reconstruction is needed. 
To learn more about Austin?s routine street maintenance, visit austintexas.gov/streetandbridge or call Street and Bridge Operations at 512.974.8777 and a representative will assist you.

Geodata,"Depicts the Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan Growth Concept Corridors.  See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location. Specifying boundaries for these centers may occur through small-area plans or general guidelines for implementing this plan.

,"This dataset reports flashing traffic signals in Austin, TX. Traffic signals enter flash mode when something is preventing the signal from operating normally. This is typically the result of a power surge, power outage, or damage to signal equipment. A signal may also be intentionally placed into flash mode for maintenance purposes or be scheduled to flash overnight. 
You can view an interactive map of flashing traffic signals here:
http://transportation.austintexas.io/signals-on-flash
You can view a historical data set of signals that have flash in the past, here:
https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Traffic-Signal-Status-Historical-BETA-/x62n-vjpq/edit_metadata
Approximately 90% of the City?s signals communicate with our Advanced Trasnportation Management System. When these signals go on flash, they will be reported in this dataset. Although we are extending communications to all signals, approximately 10% are not currently captured in this dataset. It also occasionally happens that the event that disables a traffic signal also disables network communication to the signal, in which case the signal outage will not be reported here.
In this dataset the distinction between scheduled and unscheduled flash is identified by the 'operation state' column. A signal that is in unscheduled flash mode will have a status of 2 or 7. A signal that is in in scheduled flash mode will have a status of 1.

Neighborhood,"Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan Growth Concept Centers. See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location. Specifying boundaries for these centers may occur through small-area plans or general guidelines for implementing this plan. This product is for informational purposes and may not have been prepared for or be suitable for legal, engineering, or surveying purposes. It does not represent an on-the-ground survey and represents only the approximate relative location of property boundaries.

Government,"The Urban Trails dataset describes a specific type of pedestrian and bicycle-user infrastructure. The ideal design of an Urban Trail is an off-street, 12 foot wide concrete path that can accommodate a variety of trail users including bicyclists, pedestrians, wheel chair users, parents with strollers, kids on razor scooters and so on. Since the first Urban Trails Master Plan was adopted in September 2014 not all existing trail segments in this dataset strictly comply with the guidelines described in Appendix A: Trail Design Criteria of the Urban Trails Master Plan. The Urban Trails network is intended to be a part of the greater Active Transportation Network and may relate to the on-street bicycle network or the sidewalk network, as well as City of Austin parks. In this dataset, many Urban Trail endpoints connect to the City of Austin?s streets dataset or the City of Austin?s parks dataset. 
The data in this feature class was created by the amalgamation of three datasets:  the Parks and Recreation Trail Layer (based on their Long Range Facilities Master Plan), the Neighborhood Planning Implementation Layer, and feedback and comments received during the Urban Trail Master Plan process (October 2012-September 2014)

Utility,"Austin Energy has four main customer classes: residential, commercial, industrial, and other. 
Residential customers live in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses, or individually metered apartment units. 
The majority of commercial customers are small to large businesses that fall under Austin Energy?s secondary level of service. This means Austin Energy owns, operates, and maintains the equipment (wires, transformers, etc.) supplying power to those facilities. 
Industrial (Primary) customers take service at high voltage (12,500 volts or higher) and own, operate and maintain their own equipment. Consequently, Austin Energy experiences lower overall system losses and it costs less to serve these customers. Large commercial and industrial customers such as semiconductors, high-tech facilities, and data centers typically fall under the primary level of service. These customers have very high usage and load factors because they tend to operate 24/7. 
The final class, other, typically refers to street lighting and facilities such as ballparks.",Austin Energy Customer Data by Customer Class 2006 - 2014,"['""number of customers""', 'mwh', '""percentage of mwh""', '""cents per kwh""', 'kwh']",Dataset,531.0,0.0038779787770125687

How does the City of Austin use the Bluetooth travel sensor data?
The data enables transportation engineers to better understand short and long-term trends in Austin?s traffic patterns, supporting decisions about systems planning and traffic signal timing.
What information does the data contain?
The sensor data is available in three datasets:

Individual Address Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Addresses/qnpj-zrb9/data )
Each row in this dataset represents a Bluetooth device that was detected by one of our sensors. Each record contains a detected device?s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with the time and location the device was detected. These records alone are not traffic data but can be post-processed to measure the movement of detected devices through the roadway network
Individual Traffic Matches ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Traffic-Matche/x44q-icha/data )
Each row in this dataset represents one Bluetooth enabled device that detected at two locations in the roadway network. Each record contains a detected device?s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with contain information about origin and destination points at which the device was detected, as well the time, date, and distance traveled. 
Traffic Summary Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Match-Summary-Records/v7zg-5jg9 )
The traffic summary records contain aggregate travel time and speed summaries based on the individual traffic match records. Each  row in the dataset summarizes average travel time and speed along a sensor-equipped roadway segment in 15 minute intervals.

Neighborhood,"A new component of fair housing studies is an analysis of the opportunities residents are afforded in ?racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty,? also called RCAPs or ECAPs. An RCAP or ECAP is a neighborhood with significant concentrations of extreme poverty and minority populations.
HUD?s definition of an RCAP/ECAP is:
?	A Census tract that has a non?white population of 50 percent or more AND a poverty rate of 40 percent or more; OR
?	A Census tract that has a non?white population of 50 percent or more AND the poverty rate is three times the average tract poverty rate for the metro/micro area, whichever is lower.
Why the 40 percent threshold? The RCAP/ECAP definition is not meant to suggest that a slightly?lower?than?40 percent poverty rate is ideal or acceptable. The threshold was borne out of research that concluded a 40 percent poverty rate was the point at which a neighborhood became significantly socially and economically challenged. Conversely, research has shown that areas with up to 14 percent of poverty have no noticeable effect on community opportunity. (See Section II in City of Austin?s 2015 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice: http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/NHCD/Reports_Publications/1Analysis_Impediments_for_web.pdf)

Due to the limitations of the platform, the data is not displayed how it is meant to be viewed. Please see the dark red ?About? tab for a thumbnail of how the map is ideally viewed and two attachments. One attachment is a description of the metadata and the other attachment provides instructions for how to view the data properly. 
The Strategic Areas show the degree to which City of Austin initiatives overlap each other geographically, representing opportunities for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing the Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan. 
The data set is comprised of initiatives that have been formally adopted by City Council or are from department-approved planning documents/reports. Examples include the Imagine Austin Growth Concept map, City Council-approved infrastructure master plans (i.e. the City of Austin Sidewalk Master Plan), City Council-approved Neighborhood Plans, and City Council and/or departmental accepted reports (i.e. the Hispanic-Latino Quality of Life Initiative final report). These initiatives contain recommendations for areas to invest in or focus on certain capital improvements, the geographical boundaries of which are represented in the data set. The areas with the greatest number of overlapping initiatives are indicated by the darker shades, representing areas where capital investment can have a multiplier effect in implementing several city initiatives.
The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in City plans and policies as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives.

The Strategic Investment Areas map shows the geographic location of unfunded or long-term infrastructure needs identified in the FY 2016-17 LRCSP and the degree to which those future investments could enable recommendations in multiple City of Austin initiatives, as identified in the LRCSP Strategic Areas map (see the CPO LRCSP Strategic Areas dataset on the Open Data Portal). The degree of overlap with multiple City initiatives is indicated by darker shades. The goal of the analysis is to identify strategic areas for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing Imagine Austin. The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in both infrastructure needs and City plans and policies, as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives.

This data set includes a build date and will be updated on a quarterly basis.  The data contained in this data set is for informational purposes. Certain Austin Energy budget items have been excluded as competitive matters under Texas Government Code Section 552.133 and City Council Resolution 20051201-002.
The comparison of actual expenditures to budget may appear inconsistent. That is because base wages for personnel are fully budgeted in the expense categories regular wages?full-time, regular wages?part-time or regular wages?civil service. The budget does not assume expenditure levels for the various leave categories, such as sick pay, vacation pay, or jury leave. However, actual expenses for various leave categories are recorded based on timesheet coding. The result is that actual expenditures for regular wages are spread across multiple expense categories while the budget is shown in one expense category.
Personnel savings is budgeted to account for the likely savings in personnel costs generated through attrition. However, the savings is realized in the expense categories regular wages?full-time, regular wages?part-time and regular wages?civil service. Therefore, the actual expenditures in the personnel savings expense category will always be zero.",General Fund Filter,"['controller', 'budget documents', 'raw budget data', 'austin finance online', 'austin']",Filtered View,81.0,0.0005915560846290359

https://github.com/cityofaustin/hack-the-traffic/tree/master/docs
This dataset contains aggregate travel time and speed summaries based on the individual traffic match records from the City of Austin's Bluetooth travel sensors.. Each row in the dataset summarizes average travel time and speed along a sensor-equipped roadway segment in 15 minute intervals.
How does the City of Austin use the Bluetooth travel sensor data?
The data enables transportation engineers to better understand short and long-term trends in Austin?s traffic patterns, supporting decisions about systems planning and traffic signal timing.
What information does the data contain?
The sensor data is available in three datasets:

Individual Address Records ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Addresses/qnpj-zrb9/data )
Each row in this dataset represents a Bluetooth device that was detected by one of our sensors. Each record contains a detected device?s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with the time and location the device was detected. These records alone are not traffic data but can be post-processed to measure the movement of detected devices through the roadway network
Individual Traffic Matches ( https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Bluetooth-Travel-Sensors-Individual-Traffic-Matche/x44q-icha/data )
Each row in this dataset represents one Bluetooth enabled device that detected at two locations in the roadway network. Each record contains a detected device?s anonymized Media Access Control (MAC) address along with contain information about origin and destination points at which the device was detected, as well the time, date, and distance traveled.

The table contains unaudited data that represents Green Building ratings contribution to the goals of the Austin Climate Protection Plan to reach 900 MW of peak demand savings by 2025. Beginning in 2014, Green Building commercial and multifamily ratings MW and MWh savings include a portion of the savings attributed to Customer Energy Solution rebates for AEGB rated projects.

Utility,"The Austin Energy Regional Science Festival is one of the largest regional science festivals held in Texas and the nation. Middle and high school students who win at their respective schools compete at the regional festival to advance to the state science fair competition. Five senior level projects receive Best of Fair awards and the winners of those projects have the option to advance directly to the international competition. 
Central Texas middle and high school students have performed very well at past state and international competitions. Between 2004 and 2016, 100 students representing 71 projects advanced to the international level. Of those, 44 students representing 29 projects won 73 category and special awards. Since 2004, more than 1,225 students have advanced to the state level, where about 20% have won awards.
In 2016, the Austin Energy Regional Science Festival showcased 755 middle and high school projects. Unlike most regional events, Austin Energy also hosts elementary school students.  Nearly 4,000 students and their families turn out for the event which includes a public viewing of the science projects as well as educational booths and scientific demonstrations. 
Over 550 judges and 180 volunteers from the City of Austin, local businesses, colleges, and elementary/middle/high schools contribute annually to the event?s success. Revenues to fund the event come from fees paid by participating schools and companies that provide sponsorships.",Science Festival Company Sponsors,"['fair', 'science', 'energy', 'austin energy regional science festival', 'science festival']",Dataset,58.0,0.00042358336924054423

,"In April, 2015, City Manager Marc Ott implemented the Employee Commute Reduction Program by directing all City of Austin departments to reduce employee commuting during peak periods by 20 percent.  This can be accomplished by teleworking, working alternative hours, working condensed schedules, and reducing single occupancy trips during peak hours.  By collecting baseline data regarding employees' schedules and commute habits, it was determined that nearly 74% of ARR's possible on peak commutes were already reduced by travelling off peak periods, using alternative schedules, teleworking, or by utilizing alternative transportation.  Austin Resource Recovery wanted to do even more and responded to the City Manager's initiative by implementing alternative work schedules for its administrative employees and encouraging reduction of single occupancy trips by utilizing public transportation, carpooling, and the vanpool program.",ARR Employee Commute Reduction Program,"['transportation', 'telecommute', 'vanpool', 'carpool', 'reduction']",Dataset,50.0,0.0003651580769315036

Utility,"Austin Energy has a goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 2020 to a level that is 20% below 2005 levels. CO2-equivalent is a measure used to compare the emissions of different greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential.This goal was approved by the Austin City Council in April 2010 as part of Austin Energy?s Generation Plan. From 2005 to 2012 Austin Energy stack emissions have declined by 16.5%. 
Total stack greenhouse gas emissions reported here include carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide, and are reported as metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq). Carbon dioxide equivalent is a measure used to compare the emissions of different greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential (GWP). Non-CO2 greenhouse gases make up less than 1% of Austin Energy?s stack emissions.

Utility,"Qualifying utility customers receive waivers and discounts on their utility bills. The City of Austin has one of the most generous Customer Assistance Programs in the nation. Utility bill discounts are a key component of the program. They are provided to customers already receiving benefits through a variety of federal, state, county or city assistance programs. In February 2014, the Austin City Council voted to expand the discount program to 45,000 customers a year.  Additionally, in 2015 the Austin City Council voted to no longer have a waitlist as well as include Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers as a qualifier.
Customers who qualify for utility bill discounts are receiving an average of $792 per year per family, $248 of which comes from Austin Energy.

Utility,"As part of the FY 2013 rate case, Austin Energy restructured its customer classes. 
Austin Energy?s four customer classes include: 
Residential ? customers living in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses or individually metered apartment units. 
Secondary ? commercial customers including small to large businesses. This means Austin Energy owns, operates and maintains the equipment supplying power to those facilities . 
Secondary 1 ? commercial customers served at less than 10 kW. 
Secondary 2 ? commercial customers served between 10 and 50 kW. Secondary 3 ? commercial customers served at more than 50 kW. 
Primary ? customers that take service at high voltage and own, operate and maintain their own equipment. Consequently, Austin Energy experiences lower overall system losses and expense in serving these customers. Large commercial and industrial customers such as semiconductors, hightech facilities and data centers typically fall under this level of service. These customers have very high usage and load factors because they tend to operate 24/7. 
Primary 1 ? commercial customers served at less than 3 MW. 
Primary 2 ? commercial customers served between 3 and 20 MW. 
Primary 3 ? commercial customers served at more than 20 MW.
Contract/Transmission ? customers owning and maintaining all equipment on the customer side for electric delivery and receiving service at 69 kV or above. Contract applies to a small number of large commercial customers operating under legacy contracts.

Utility bill discounts are a key component of the program. They are provided to customers already receiving benefits through a variety of federal, state, county or city assistance programs. In February 2014, the Austin City Council voted to expand the discount program to 45,000 customers a year.  Additionally, in 2015 the Austin City Council voted to no longer have a waitlist as well as include Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers as a qualifier.
Under the program, qualifying Austin Energy customers receive a waiver of the $10 monthly electric customer charge; are exempt from paying the portion of the community benefit charge that supports the Utility Bill Discount Program; and they receive a 10% discount on their kWh usage charge. Austin Water customers also receive a discount on the water/wastewater customer charge as well as a volumetric discount on a customer?s water usage. Watershed Protection provides a 50% discount on the drainage fee. Public Works under a separate qualification waives the transportation user fee. 

Customers who qualify for utility bill discounts are receiving an average of $792 per year per family, $248 of which comes from Austin Energy.

Utility,"Austin Energy offers free weatherization services to qualifying low-income, elderly and physically/mentally disabled customers. Each of the homes reduces its energy use by an average of about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually due to these improvements. The program provides up to $1,500 in home improvements including installation of attic insulation, sealing and repair of ducts, solar screen installations, weather stripping around entry doors, and minor home repairs necessary to improve the effectiveness of the efficiency improvements.
In FY 2010, Austin Energy received a grant of nearly $5.9 million from American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds that allowed for the weatherization of 1,064 homes and apartments for low-income, elderly, and disabled customers within Austin Energy?s service area. Under this program, each dwelling received, on average, about $5,000 worth of improvements including new energy efficient appliances and air conditioning and heating equipment.
Because Austin Energy's implementation of the program was so successful, the utility received additional funding on three separate occasions in the amounts of $2.1 million, $200,000 and $1 million, for total funds of $9.2 million. This allowed the utility to nearly double the number of units receiving this enhanced free weatherization. 
Under the Federal Weatherization Program which ended April 30, 2012, Austin Energy weatherized  1,886 homes, 77% more than the original goal of 1,064 homes. The homes were occupied by 4,529 people of whom 645 were elderly, 572 had disabilities and 758 were children under the age of 5. On average, each of the homes will save about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually in energy costs due to the improvements.
*In FY 2010 127 of the 456 homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds. 
*In FY 2011 all homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds. 
*In FY 2012, the 715 homes used both ARRA funds and AE funds.

Utility,"Austin Energy set a goal that 35% of energy delivered to customers will come from renewable resources by 2020. Download type, capacity, term, and more for each of Austin Energy?s agreements to purchase power generated by wind, solar, and biomass.
Austin Energy has approximately 850 megawatts of wind power through purchase power agreements with terms ranging from 10 to 25 years, and one short-term agreement. Austin Energy set a goal that 35% of energy delivered to customers will come from renewable resources by 2020. In January 2013, two new wind contracts went online adding an additional 293.9 megawatts of wind power.  Additionally, Austin Energy is purchasing energy produced from the 30 megawatt Webberville Solar Project and a 100 megawatt biomass plant which went online in June 2012. Purchase power agreements for wind, solar and biomass power will bring our renewable portfolio to 23% by the end of 2013. In June 2013 the Austin City Council approved three new wind contracts totaling 570 megawatts which will put the utility four years ahead of schedule for meeting its 35% renewable energy resources goal by 2020.

The Comptroller does not make determinations regarding the accuracy or veracity of reports received under this chapter.  Rather, it is incumbent upon the reporting entity to determine whether it possesses eminent domain authority such that it is required to submit a report in accordance with ?2206.154, and to identify in that report which provisions in law grant the entity that authority. 
The Comptroller may determine that an entity is not in compliance with the requirements of Subchapter D if the entity has previously submitted a report of eminent domain authority as required under Government Code ?2206.101 or 2206.154, but subsequently fails to file the report in later years and fails to inform the Comptroller of changes to the entity?s eminent domain authority (in accordance with ?2206.154(c)) that would relieve the entity from future reporting obligations.  Should an entity that has previously submitted a report of eminent domain authority later inform the Comptroller that a change has occurred such that the entity no longer possesses eminent domain authority or is required to submit a report in accordance with ?2206.154, that entity will not be placed on the noncompliant entities list (or will be removed from the list, as the case may be).",Eminent Domain Noncompliant Entities List,['eminent domain'],Dataset,27.0,0.00019718536154301198

Accounts not brought current after delivery of the notice will be disconnected within a couple of days.  This table shows the number of accounts disconnected for non-payment starting in 2002.

If services are disconnected, the following reconnection fees apply:
$25.00 reconnection fee
$55.00 additional fee for same day service reconnection if requested ($80 total for same day)
Summer Disconnects:
Cuts for non-payment are halted anytime the heat index reaches or exceeds 102 degrees one day and is expected to reach or exceed 102 degrees on the following day.
Winter Disconnects:
Cuts for non-payment are suspended if the National Weather Service forecasts the next day to be at or below 32 degrees, or at below 35 degrees with a greater than 50% chance of precipitation.
Austin Energy suspended the issuance of disconnects for non-pay in FY 2012 due to the implementation of the new customer billing system. This allowed the utility to spend time quality assuring the system prior to the commencement of collections activities.
For FY 2011, utility bills delinquent by 30 days or more averaged $16.2 million per month.
