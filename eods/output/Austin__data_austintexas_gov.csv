This data set includes a build date and will be updated on a quarterly basis.  The data contained in this data set is for informational purposes. Certain Austin Energy budget items have been excluded as competitive matters under Texas Government Code Section 552.133 and City Council Resolution 20051201-002.
The comparison of actual expenditures to budget may appear inconsistent. That is because base wages for personnel are fully budgeted in the expense categories regular wages?full-time, regular wages?part-time or regular wages?civil service. The budget does not assume expenditure levels for the various leave categories, such as sick pay, vacation pay, or jury leave. However, actual expenses for various leave categories are recorded based on timesheet coding. The result is that actual expenditures for regular wages are spread across multiple expense categories while the budget is shown in one expense category.
Personnel savings is budgeted to account for the likely savings in personnel costs generated through attrition. However, the savings is realized in the expense categories regular wages?full-time, regular wages?part-time and regular wages?civil service. Therefore, the actual expenditures in the personnel savings expense category will always be zero.",Program Budget Operating Budget Vs Expense Raw Data,"['controller', 'budget documents', 'raw budget data', 'austin finance online', 'austin']",Dataset,2503.0,0.018246765081100784

Each year, the Public Works Street and Bridge Operations performs street preventative maintenance to over 700 street segments to help offset the cost of expensive road repairs. 
Why do we do this? Having scheduled preventative maintenance will help prolong the life of the streets by protecting the surface from the effects of aging, cracking, deterioration, and water infiltration. Additionally, prolonging the life of our city streets by using these methods saves taxpayer money by intervening before full reconstruction is needed. 
To learn more about Austin?s routine street maintenance, visit austintexas.gov/streetandbridge or call Street and Bridge Operations at 512.974.8777 and a representative will assist you.

Geodata,"Depicts the Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan Growth Concept Corridors.  See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location. Specifying boundaries for these centers may occur through small-area plans or general guidelines for implementing this plan.

,"This dataset reports flashing traffic signals in Austin, TX. Traffic signals enter flash mode when something is preventing the signal from operating normally. This is typically the result of a power surge, power outage, or damage to signal equipment. A signal may also be intentionally placed into flash mode for maintenance purposes or be scheduled to flash overnight. 
You can view an interactive map of flashing traffic signals here:
http://transportation.austintexas.io/signals-on-flash
You can view a historical data set of signals that have flash in the past, here:
https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Traffic-Signal-Status-Historical-BETA-/x62n-vjpq/edit_metadata
Approximately 90% of the City?s signals communicate with our Advanced Trasnportation Management System. When these signals go on flash, they will be reported in this dataset. Although we are extending communications to all signals, approximately 10% are not currently captured in this dataset. It also occasionally happens that the event that disables a traffic signal also disables network communication to the signal, in which case the signal outage will not be reported here.
In this dataset the distinction between scheduled and unscheduled flash is identified by the 'operation state' column. A signal that is in unscheduled flash mode will have a status of 2 or 7. A signal that is in in scheduled flash mode will have a status of 1.

Government,"The Urban Trails dataset describes a specific type of pedestrian and bicycle-user infrastructure. The ideal design of an Urban Trail is an off-street, 12 foot wide concrete path that can accommodate a variety of trail users including bicyclists, pedestrians, wheel chair users, parents with strollers, kids on razor scooters and so on. Since the first Urban Trails Master Plan was adopted in September 2014 not all existing trail segments in this dataset strictly comply with the guidelines described in Appendix A: Trail Design Criteria of the Urban Trails Master Plan. The Urban Trails network is intended to be a part of the greater Active Transportation Network and may relate to the on-street bicycle network or the sidewalk network, as well as City of Austin parks. In this dataset, many Urban Trail endpoints connect to the City of Austin?s streets dataset or the City of Austin?s parks dataset. 
The data in this feature class was created by the amalgamation of three datasets:  the Parks and Recreation Trail Layer (based on their Long Range Facilities Master Plan), the Neighborhood Planning Implementation Layer, and feedback and comments received during the Urban Trail Master Plan process (October 2012-September 2014)

Residential customers live in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses, or individually metered apartment units. 
The majority of commercial customers are small to large businesses that fall under Austin Energy?s secondary level of service. This means Austin Energy owns, operates, and maintains the equipment (wires, transformers, etc.) supplying power to those facilities. 
Industrial (Primary) customers take service at high voltage (12,500 volts or higher) and own, operate and maintain their own equipment. Consequently, Austin Energy experiences lower overall system losses and it costs less to serve these customers. Large commercial and industrial customers such as semiconductors, high-tech facilities, and data centers typically fall under the primary level of service. These customers have very high usage and load factors because they tend to operate 24/7. 
The final class, other, typically refers to street lighting and facilities such as ballparks.",Austin Energy Customer Data by Customer Class 2006 - 2014,"['""number of customers""', 'mwh', '""percentage of mwh""', '""cents per kwh""', 'kwh']",Dataset,534.0,0.003892837616183707
