Each year, the Public Works Street and Bridge Operations performs street preventative maintenance to over 700 street segments to help offset the cost of expensive road repairs. 
Why do we do this? Having scheduled preventative maintenance will help prolong the life of the streets by protecting the surface from the effects of aging, cracking, deterioration, and water infiltration. Additionally, prolonging the life of our city streets by using these methods saves taxpayer money by intervening before full reconstruction is needed.
