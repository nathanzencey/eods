The HNP pest control intervention involves providing products (such as traps and cleaning supplies) and educating residents about removing harborage and food for pests by storing garbage appropriately, cleaning, and repairing holes that give mice entry into the home.  In some cases, the HNP contacts local code enforcement or the landlord.We can see that the initial visit percentages vary substantially across the across counties, which could reflect differing geography, urban versus rural target areas, and the quality of the housing stock.

SONYMA also relates each of its single-family mortgages to a specific census tract or block numbering area. New York State identifies ?areas of chronic economic distress? using census tract numbers. 26 US Code ? 143 (current through Pub. L. 114-38) defines the criteria that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development uses in approving designations of ?areas of chronic economic distress? as: i) the condition of the housing stock, including the age of the housing and the number of abandoned and substandard residential units, (ii) the need of area residents for owner-financing under this section, as indicated by low per capita income, a high percentage of families in poverty, a high number of welfare recipients, and high unemployment rates, (iii) the potential for use of owner-financing under this section to improve housing conditions in the area, and (iv) the existence of a housing assistance plan which provides a displacement program and a public improvements and services program. The US Census Bureau?s decennial census last took place in 2010 and will take place again in 2020. While the state designates ?areas of chronic economic distress,? the US Department of Housing and Urban Development must approve the designation. The designation takes place after the decennial census.",SONYMA Target Areas by Census Tract,[],Data Lens,14139,0.003051785Health,"This dataset includes Medicaid clinical metrics for Clinical Improvement Projects (Domain 3) of the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program.

This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.

PLEASE READ DISCLAIMER BEFORE USING DATA. The One- to Four-Family Home Performance with ENERGY STAR? Program is a market transformation program that uses Building Performance Institute (BPI) Goldstar contractors to install comprehensive energy-efficient improvements. The program is designed to use building science and a whole-house approach to reduce energy use in the State?s existing one-to-four family and low-rise multifamily residential buildings and capture heating fuel and electricity-related savings. The Program provides incentives on eligible energy efficiency improvements including building shell measures, high efficiency heating and cooling measures, ENERGY STAR appliances and lighting.D I S C L A I M E R: Estimated Annual kWh Savings, Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings, and First Year Energy Savings $ Estimate represent contractor reported savings derived from energy modeling software calculations and not actual realized energy savings. The accuracy of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings for projects has been evaluated by an independent third party. The results of the impact analysis indicate that, on average, actual savings amount to 35 percent of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and 65 percent of the Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings. The analysis did not evaluate every single project, but rather a sample of projects from 2007 and 2008, so the results are applicable to the population on average but not necessarily to any individual project which could have over or under achieved in comparison to the evaluated savings. The results from the impact analysis will be updated when more recent information is available. While many factors influence the degree to which estimated savings are realized, including the use of the modeling software itself, some reasons individual households may realize savings different from those projected include, but are not limited to, changes in the number or needs of members of a household, changes in occupancy schedules, changes in energy usage behaviors or appliances and electronics installed in the home, or beginning or ending a home business. In addition, the program has evolved since the last impact analysis, introducing a change in the mix of measures that are installed, and use of additional modeling software tools and protocols. Further, with the current technology improvements and regulatory changes being considered we are actively working toward a more accurate future.

The program is designed to use building science and a whole-house approach to reduce energy use in the State?s existing one-to-four family and low-rise multifamily residential buildings and capture heating fuel and electricity-related savings.  The Program provides incentives on eligible energy efficiency improvements including building shell measures, high efficiency heating and cooling measures, ENERGY STAR appliances and lighting. D I S C L A I M E R: Estimated Annual kWh Savings, Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings, and First Year Energy Savings $ Estimate represent contractor reported savings derived from energy modeling software calculations and not actual realized energy savings. The accuracy of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings for projects has been evaluated by an independent third party. The results of the impact analysis indicate that, on average, actual savings amount to 35 percent of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and 65 percent of the Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings. The analysis did not evaluate every single project, but rather a sample of projects from 2007 and 2008, so the results are applicable to the population on average but not necessarily to any individual project which could have over or under achieved in comparison to the evaluated savings. The results from the impact analysis will be updated when more recent information is available. While many factors influence the degree to which estimated savings are realized, including the use of the modeling software itself, some reasons individual households may realize savings different from those projected include, but are not limited to, changes in the number or needs of members of a household, changes in occupancy schedules, changes in energy usage behaviors or appliances and electronics installed in the home, or beginning or ending a home business. In addition, the program has evolved since the last impact analysis, introducing a change in the mix of measures that are installed, and use of additional modeling software tools and protocols.  Further, with the current technology improvements and regulatory changes being considered we are actively working toward a more accurate future.
