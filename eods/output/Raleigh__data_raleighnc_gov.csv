Urban Planning,"HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center conducts physical property inspections of properties that are owned, insured or subsidized by HUD, including public housing and multifamily assisted housing. About 20,000 such inspections are conducted each year to ensure that assisted families have housing that is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. This page provides a full historical view of the results of those inspections, providing point-in-time property scores. Results are available for download as a comma-delimited dataset. Separate datasets are available for public housing and for multifamily assisted properties. The results represent the inspections conducted from 2001 through January 2015. The dataset includes property identifiers and location information.
Detailed descriptions of the inspection processes can be found in Federal Register notices 66 FR 59084 for public housing and 65 FR77230 for Office of Housing programs.
Making these inspection details available will enable researchers, advocacy groups and the general public to 
* better understand the physical condition of the HUD-assisted housing stock, as well as changes in the stock over time; 
* hold providers accountable for housing quality; and 
* plan for future affordable housing needs.",Multifamily Physical Inspection Scores 2013-2016,"['public housing', 'inspections', 'housing', 'hud']",Dataset,204.0,0.018774157923799006

Public Safety,"The purpose of this data is to allow users to view the locations of crashes involving bicyclists and pedestrians in North Carolina. The data comes from police-reported bicycle-motor vehicle and pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions that occurred on the public roadway network, public vehicular areas and private properties (if reported) from January 2007 through December 2013. Users are able to click and view information specific to each crash. Information for each crash includes: County, City, Crash Date, Crash Day, Crash Group, Crash Location, Crash Time, Crash Severity, Bike/Pedestrian Age Group, Bike/Pedestrian Alcohol Detected, Bike Direction, Bike/Pedestrian Injury, Bike/Pedestrian Position, Bike/Pedestrian Race, Bike/Pedestrian Sex, Ambulance Response, Driver Age Group, Driver Estimated Speed, Speed Limit, Driver Alcohol Detected, Driver Injury, Driver Race, Driver Sex, Driver Vehicle Type, Hit and Run, Development, Light Condition, Locality, Number of Lanes, Road Characteristics/Class/Condition/Configuration, Road Defects/Features, Traffic Control, Crash Type, and/or Weather. Crash identification numbers have been removed from the data for protection of privacy. Crash records were obtained NCDOT?s Traffic Engineering Accident Analysis System (TEAAS). The University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center queried the data to identify potential pedestrian and bicycle crashes using the variables that describe people and vehicles involved in reported crashes throughout North Carolina. Valid bicycle and pedestrian crashes were geocoded to generate latitude and longitude coordinates and crash-typed using PBCAT (Pedestrian and Bicycle Crash Analysis Tool) software. These data elements were linked with crash variables from the NC crash database. For geocoding, roadway information was used to initially identify an intersection near the crash. A geocode request was sent to Google for each intersection, which returns coordinate information. A Google Earth-compatible file was built containing the nearby placemarks for the identified crashes of sites purchased and/or maintained by NCDOT for stream, wetland, or threatened & endangered species mitigation credit as part of various environmental permits. They include projects built both off- and onsite throughout the state, as well as projects done as full delivery from consultants and projects partially built or managed by other agencies (e.g. NC Ecosystem Enhancement Program or EEP). The sites in this map are only a portion of the known sites in the state, as the database they were pulled from is a work in progress. Images of crash report forms were obtained from DMV and used for validation, crash-typing and geocoding. To geocode, the coders examined the hardcopies and moved the placemarks into a more accurate location. After coding was completed, the crash type data was extracted and joined to information from the NC crash data. The latitude and longitude were extracted from the Google Earth-compatible file and joined with the rest of the data. For each year of crash data, approximately 99% of crashes had sufficient information to be geocoded. Although effort was made to code locations with a high degree of accuracy and using all available information from the crash report, users should be aware that the accuracy and precision of these data are affected by the accuracy and level of precision in crash reporting as well as errors that may enter the data during data entry and coding. For example, crash locations are often specified to only the nearest 0.10 mile. It is further likely that many of the locations in crash data are estimated rather than resulting from an actual measurement at the crash scene. Injured cyclists may also be transported for medical treatment prior to investigating officers? arrival on the scene, reducing their input regarding crash location.

A Stormwater account exists to facilitate public payments into a fund to prevent stormwater damage that naturally arises from water runoff that accumulates as a result of our built environment of pavement and other hard surfaces (known as ""impervious surfaces""). This damage comes in the form of flooding of our roads and private property and water quality damage to our river/stream ecosystem.  Each property owner pays a small fee according to the amount of impervious surface on their property or property for which it shares some obligation. 
This dataset includes the combination of primary property accounts that pay directly for their impervious surface, as well as accounts that pay a portion (named ""Apportionment Accounts"") of another property's impervious surface.

What are impaired waters? Impaired waters are where water quality samples for a particular parameter on a waterbody exceed water quality standards and the assessment methodology has determined that the waterbody is indeed impaired for the particular parameter.  The 303(d) list is comprised of category 5 waters of the water quality assessment. Category 5 waters are those that require a TMDL or TMDL alternative. These Category 5 waters are assembled in a single document (the 303(d) list) and sent to EPA on April 1st of every even numbered year, per 40 CFR 130.7. EPA must approve, disapprove, or partially approve each 303(d) list.

Urban Planning,"HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center conducts physical property inspections of properties that are owned, insured or subsidized by HUD, including public housing and multifamily assisted housing. About 20,000 such inspections are conducted each year to ensure that assisted families have housing that is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair.
This page provides a full historical view of the results of those inspections, providing point-in-time property scores. Separate datails available for public housing and for multifamily assisted properties.
The results represent the inspections conducted from 2001 through September 2009. The data includes property identifiers and location information. Detailed descriptions of the inspection processes can be found in Federal Register notices 66 FR 59084 for public housing and 65 FR77230 for Office of Housing programs. Making these inspection details available will enable researchers, advocacy groups and the general public to:
* better understand the physical condition of the HUD-assisted housing stock, as well as changes in the stock over time;
* hold providers accountable for housing quality; and
* plan for future affordable housing needs.",Multifamily Physical Inspection Scores 2011,"['multifamily', 'public housing', 'inspections', 'housing', 'hud']",Dataset,2.0,0.00018406037180195104
