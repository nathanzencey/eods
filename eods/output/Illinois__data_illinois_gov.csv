Asbestos Licensed Professionals fall into six major categories. 
o	Supervisors are the Contractor's designees on asbestos abatement projects and are responsible for ensuring that work is conducted in accordance with state and federal regulations. 
o	Project Managers are the building owner's or school district's representative on school projects and are responsible for ensuring that the workers and supervisors are complying with the contract specification and state and federal regulations. Projects Managers are not required to oversee asbestos abatement projects in commercial and public buildings, but if a building owner chooses to have an individual oversee the project, then the Department requires that the person be licensed. 
o	Air Sampling Professionals are responsible for taking air samples to determine the airborne concentration of asbestos inside and outside the work area. The Air Sampling Professional conducts aggressive clearance air monitoring at the end of asbestos abatement projects to ensure that the concentration of asbestos in the air is acceptable for reoccupation of the area. 
o	Project Designers are required to develop project designs for school buildings. The project designers are required to draw up specifications and contracts that contractors must follow to complete an asbestos abatement project that meets state and federal regulations. If a project design is developed for asbestos abatement in commercial and public buildings, then it must be completed by a licensed Project Designer.
o	Inspectors are required to identify asbestos-containing materials by sampling suspected asbestos-containing materials discovered during an inspection. 
o	Management Planners are required to develop management plans based upon information from an Inspector. Each school in Illinois must develop and maintain an asbestos management plan describing the management of the school's asbestos-containing building materials.

As actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model, each component of population change ? birth, death and net migration ? is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort ? component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation: P1 = P0 + B ?

Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows: for every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex, is ?survived? to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July 1, 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties, the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb, Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown, Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery, Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population, these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS), Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties, the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections, depending on the birth trend of each county.

,"Introduction
This report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. 
As actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. 
Methodology
These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model, each component of population change ? birth, death and net migration ? is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex.  The cohort ? component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation:
                P1 = P0 + B ? D + NM
Where:
                P1 = Population at the end of the period;
                P0 = Population at the beginning of the period;
                B = Resident births during the period;
                D = Resident deaths during the period; and
           NM = Net migration (Inmigration ? Outmigration) during the period.
The model roughly works as  follows: for every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex, is ?survived? to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). 
Base Population
These projections began with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July 1, 2010 population estimates. 
Special Populations
In 19 counties, the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb, Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown, Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery, Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population, these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period.
Mortality 
Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011.

,"Introduction This report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. As actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model, each component of population change ? birth, death and net migration ? is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort ? component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation: P1 = P0 + B ? D + NM Where: P1 = Population at the end of the period; P0 = Population at the beginning of the period; B = Resident births during the period; D = Resident deaths during the period; and NM = Net migration (Inmigration ? Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows: for every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex, is ?survived? to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July 1, 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties, the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb, Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown, Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery, Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population, these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS), Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties, the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections, depending on the birth trend of each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each project",IDPH Population Projections For Chicago By Age And Sex 2010 To 2025,"['sex', 'age', 'projections', 'population', 'estimates']",Dataset,541.0,0.005893952434387562

The most common strain that does this is E. coli O157:H7, but there are several other closely related strains that also produce Shiga toxin. The major symptom of illness is diarrhea, which may be bloody. Severe cases of STEC may result in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) which, in turn, may lead to acute renal dysfunction necessitating the use of dialysis. While anyone may contract illness, children under age 5 and the elderly seem to be most prone to serious complications.",05to12 Iquery STECData,[],Dataset,447.0,0.00486986458072318

,"The reported number of illnesses caused by strains of the Influenza virus that required the case to be in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during a hospital stay. Influenza, commonly called ""the flu,"" is an infection of the respiratory tract caused by the influenza virus. Compared with most viral respiratory infections, such as the common cold, influenza infection often causes a more severe illness. Typical influenza illness includes fever (usually 100 degrees F to 103 degrees F in adults and often even higher in children) and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle aches and extreme fatigue. Although nausea, vomiting and diarrhea can sometimes accompany influenza infection, especially in children, these symptoms are rarely the primary symptoms. The term ""stomach flu"" is a misnomer that is sometimes used to describe gastrointestinal illnesses caused by organisms other than influenza viruses. During most flu seasons, which typically run from November to April, between 10 percent and 20 percent of the population is infected with influenza viruses. Most people who get the flu recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. Flu-related complications can occur at any age, but the elderly and people with chronic health problems are much more likely to develop serious complications after influenza infection than are young, healthier people. Since 2010, IDPH has collected information about influenza cases that required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization as a way to measure the severity of disease.",10to12 Iquery Flu Data,[],Dataset,436.0,0.004750024512741178

,"Introduction This report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. As actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model, each component of population change ? birth, death and net migration ? is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort ? component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation: P1 = P0 + B ? D + NM Where: P1 = Population at the end of the period; P0 = Population at the beginning of the period; B = Resident births during the period; D = Resident deaths during the period; and NM = Net migration (Inmigration ? Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows: for every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex, is ?survived? to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July 1, 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties, the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb, Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown, Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery, Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population, these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS), Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties, the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections, depending on the birth trend of each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each project",IDPH Population Projections For Illinois By Age And Sex 2010 To 2025,"['sex', 'age', 'projections', 'population', 'estimates']",Dataset,360.0,0.0039220385885018905

,"The West Nile Virus (WNV) is an arbovirus, short for arthropod-borne virus, is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes of the Culex species. These mosquitoes thrive in hot weather and are less noticeable than typical floodwater mosquitoes. Since transmission is dependent on mosquitoes, WNV is typically acquired during warmer months until first freeze of the fall. Most persons bitten by an infected mosquito will experience no symptoms of the disease or will have very mild symptoms including fever and headache. Persons older than 50 years of age are most susceptible to developing serious illness. Approximately 1 to 2 percent of all cases will develop recognizable symptoms. Symptoms of a severe WNV infection may produce a rapid onset of severe headache, high fever, muscle aches, difficulty with muscle coordination, and disorientation. Most patients recover fully, although severe infection may, infrequently, result in neurologic damage or death.",05to12 Iquery WNVData,[],Dataset,341.0,0.0037150421074420683

Social/Healthcare,"There are two types of life tables ?cohort/generational and current/period life tables.
Cohort life tables are constructed using the mortality experience of the cohort and may not be
useful for the cohort itself because every member of the cohort has to die before such a table can
be constructed. A current or period life table uses current mortality experience applied to a
cohort of births to compute the life table. On the basis of age intervals, life tables are classified as
complete or abridged. A complete life table uses exact single years and an abridged life table
uses age intervals. This report presents five-year age interval abridged current life tables.
Computation of an abridged life table from which life expectancy is derived requires
mainly population and death data by age and sex. In this report, population data consist of the
1990, 2000, and 2010 census counts of residents of each Illinois County and the city of Chicago.
These data were aggregated into five-year age groups and by sex and used as denominators in
computing mortality rates. The death data were received from the Illinois Center for Health
Statistics (ICHS) of the Office of Health Informatics (OHI). ICHS receives these data from the
Illinois Vital Records System (IVRS). Number of deaths by sex and specific age for each county
were obtained from 1989 to 2011 and aggregated at county level by five-year age groups for
each sex. Three-year averages were then computed for the periods 1989-1991, 1999-2001, and
2009-2011 and were used as numerators in computing mortality rates.
The overall life tables were constructed using Chiang?s (1984) Method II. This method
assumes a homogeneous population in which all individuals are subjected to the same force of
mortality, and in which survival of an individual is independent of the survival of any other
individual in the group. The method does not remove fluctuations in observed data; therefore, the 
2
produced life tables exhibit more the factual mortality pattern in the actual data and less the
underlying mortality picture of the populations. Margin of errors were computed to provide basis
for evaluating the accuracy of the estimated life expectancies.","IDPH Life Expectancy at Age 65  by Sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois Counties: 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011","['idph', 'life expectancy', 'life expectancy 65']",Dataset,213.0,0.0023205394981969515

Health,"NOTES:
1984: Based on 9 1/2 months of reported data.
1985-1986: Since the Illinois Department of Public Health was prohibited from mandating abortion reporting by a temporary restraining order issued in 1984, these numbers were generated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from voluntary reports submitted by Illinois abortion facilities.
1987-1992: In 1987, CDC turned over the annual voluntary survey of facilities performing abortions to the Department.
1993: No data was collected.
1994: A settlement to the 1984 temporary restraining order was reached in the fall of 1993 that allowed Illinois to resume mandatory reporting of abortions. In May 1994, health care providers were notified of the settlement and the Department outlined reporting requirements, including instructions that information on all procedures from Jan. 1, 1994 on be submitted. However, since only about 1,000 abortion reports were received for the first four months of the year, data for 1994 should be considered incomplete.

Social/Healthcare,"There are two types of life tables ?cohort/generational and current/period life tables.
Cohort life tables are constructed using the mortality experience of the cohort and may not be
useful for the cohort itself because every member of the cohort has to die before such a table can
be constructed. A current or period life table uses current mortality experience applied to a
cohort of births to compute the life table. On the basis of age intervals, life tables are classified as
complete or abridged. A complete life table uses exact single years and an abridged life table
uses age intervals. This report presents five-year age interval abridged current life tables.
Computation of an abridged life table from which life expectancy is derived requires
mainly population and death data by age and sex. In this report, population data consist of the
1990, 2000, and 2010 census counts of residents of each Illinois County and the city of Chicago.
These data were aggregated into five-year age groups and by sex and used as denominators in
computing mortality rates. The death data were received from the Illinois Center for Health
Statistics (ICHS) of the Office of Health Informatics (OHI). ICHS receives these data from the
Illinois Vital Records System (IVRS). Number of deaths by sex and specific age for each county
were obtained from 1989 to 2011 and aggregated at county level by five-year age groups for
each sex. Three-year averages were then computed for the periods 1989-1991, 1999-2001, and
2009-2011 and were used as numerators in computing mortality rates.
The overall life tables were constructed using Chiang?s (1984) Method II. This method
assumes a homogeneous population in which all individuals are subjected to the same force of
mortality, and in which survival of an individual is independent of the survival of any other
individual in the group. The method does not remove fluctuations in observed data; therefore, the 
2
produced life tables exhibit more the factual mortality pattern in the actual data and less the
underlying mortality picture of the populations. Margin of errors were computed to provide basis
for evaluating the accuracy of the estimated life expectancies.","IDPH Life Expectancy at Birth by Sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois Counties: 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011","['idph', 'life expectancy']",Dataset,143.0,0.0015579208837660286

Illnesses caused by these other serotypes, known collectively as non-typhoidal Salmonella, are reported as Salmonellosis. In severe cases of Typhoid fever, delirium may occur during the course of disease. In fact, the term typhoid is derived from the Greek word for hazy, which described the mental state of cases during this phase. Other common symptoms of typhoid fever may include one or more of weakness, stomach aches, head-ache and loss of appetite.
