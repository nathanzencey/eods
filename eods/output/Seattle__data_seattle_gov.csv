,"The Street Network Database (SND) is a representation of the physical, land based, improved, travel pathway infrastructure and associated theoretical address ranges. The pathway representation consists of Segments and Intersection elements. A Segment is a linear graphic element that represents a continuous physical travel path terminated by path end (dead end) or physical intersection with other travel paths. Segments have one streetname, one address range and one set of segment characteristics. A Segment may have none or multiple alias streetnames. Segment types included are Freeways, Highways, Streets, Alleys (named only), Railroads, Walkways, and Bikelanes. SNDSEG is a linear feature class representing the SND Segment Feature, with attributes for Streetname, Address Range, Alias Streetname and segment Characteristics objects. Part of the Address Range and all of Streetname objects are logically shared with the Discrete Address Point-Master Address File layer. Please refer to the SND Business Rules.htm document included in the .zip file for additional information.",Street Network Database,"['streets', 'snd', 'street network database']",File or Document,4052.0,0.021414000486201394

Since 2000, the City's Information Technology Indicators project has been collecting extensive and statistically valid data on residential use of cable tv, broadband adoption and uses (including health, work, education, finance and civic engagement), barriers to broadband adoption, and customer service needs. This project is managed by our Community Technology Program with technical advice from our Citizens Telecommunications and Technology Advisory Board (CTTAB).  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DATA SET
Do not pull down the data set and use it without using the code book. When you run the data set, be sure to refer to the Code Book for invalid or missing values for each question item (variables). 
You must recognize that the data here is unweighted; to replicate the figures in the City?s Information Technology Access and Adoption Report and get values that are representative of Seattle population, you should use the weights. There are 2 weighting variables, one that allows you to use the phone and online survey together (labeled ""weightfin"") and one that is for only the phone survey (labeled ""wgtphoneonly"", which excludes or zeros out everyone in the online survey).",COS DO- IT Phone And Online Survey Data 2013 Alpha,[],Dataset,2073.0,0.01095538573738783

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DATA SET
Do not pull down the data set and use it without using the code book. When you run the data set, be sure to refer to the Code Book for invalid or missing values for each question item (variables). 
You must recognize that the data here is unweighted; to replicate the figures in the City?s Information Technology Access and Adoption Report and get values that are representative of Seattle population, you should use the weights. There are 2 weighting variables, one that allows you to use the phone and online survey together (labeled ""weightfin"") and one that is for only the phone survey (labeled ""wgtphoneonly"", which excludes or zeros out everyone in the online survey).",COS DO- IT Phone And Online Survey Data 2013,[],Dataset,1025.0,0.005416917694559829
