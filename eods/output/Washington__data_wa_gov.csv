To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.  Study findings are representative at the statewide level as well as by planning region.

Natural Resources & Environment,"Routine freshwater monitoring data collected by the The WA State Department of Ecology's River and Stream Monitoring Program are summarized by a technique called the ""Water Quality Index"" (WQI).  The WQI ranges from 1 (poor quality) to 100 (good quality). The WQI summary does not include non-standard elements like metals. For temperature, pH, oxygen, and fecal coliform bacteria, the WQI is based on criteria in Washington?s Water Quality Standards, WAC 173-201A. 
For nutrient and sediment measures where standards are not specific, results are based on expected conditions in a given region. Multiple constituents are combined and results aggregated over time to produce a single score for each station and each year. 
The WQI station map shows the WQI annual scores for all stations from 2013.  These maps show status at the individual stations but also give a general sense of water quality conditions .

Politics,"This data set an index to all PDC imaged reports and documents. Political disclosure reports are included for the last 10 years. Other document types are included based on the PDC record retention schedule or 10 years. The number of years is determined by looking at both the election year and date submitted and including documents that meet either criteria (favoring the inclusion of documents). Each record contains a link to view the actual imaged document or a link on how to request the document for F1 statements of financial affairs.
The dataset includes both original and amended reports and documents. Data consumers must look at the individual documents to determine if a particular document has been superseded by an amendment. For example, a candidate might file a C4 summary report and file an amendment to the report. There is no indicator on the original C4 that it has been amended. For most documents, amendments have the term ""AMENDED"" as part of the origin field but the original document will not contain any indicator that it has been superseded by an amendment.
Lobbyist L1, L2 and L3 reports are included through 2015 and partial records for 2016. In mid 2016 the PDC discontinued imaging lobbyist L1, L2 and L3 reports. Please refer to the ""Lobbyist Compensation and Expenses"" dataset or the PDC online filing system at https://accesshub.pdc.wa.gov for the complete 2016 and later lobbyist information. The statement above does not apply to Public Agency Lobbying (L5) reports.
This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Natural Resources & Environment,"Routine freshwater monitoring data collected by the The WA State Department of Ecology's River and Stream Monitoring Program are summarized by a technique called the ""Water Quality Index"" (WQI).  The WQI ranges from 1 (poor quality) to 100 (good quality). The WQI summary does not include non-standard elements like metals. For temperature, pH, oxygen, and fecal coliform bacteria, the WQI is based on criteria in Washington?s Water Quality Standards, WAC 173-201A. 
For nutrient and sediment measures where standards are not specific, results are based on expected conditions in a given region. Multiple constituents are combined and results aggregated over time to produce a single score for each station and each year. 
The WQI station map shows the WQI annual scores for all stations from 2013.  These maps show status at the individual stations but also give a general sense of water quality conditions . This often doesn't apply higher in the watersheds where we have very little WQI-type data--though downstream results can provide clues about what's happening upstream.",WQI - Hood Canal,"['ecology', '2013 river and stream water quality monitoirng data', 'water quality index']",Map,352.0,0.001844477048836722
