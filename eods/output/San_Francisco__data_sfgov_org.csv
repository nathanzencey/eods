Geographic Locations and Boundaries,"The Department of Public Health and the Mayor?s Office of Housing and Community Development, with support from the Planning Department, created 41 neighborhoods by grouping 2010 Census tracts, using common real estate and residents? definitions for the purpose of providing consistency in the analysis and reporting of socio-economic, demographic, and environmental data, and data on City-funded programs and services. They are not codified in Planning Code nor Administrative Code.
This dataset is produced by assigning Census tracts to neighborhoods based on existing neighborhood definitions used by Planning and MOHCD. A qualitative assessment is made to identify the appropriate neighborhood for a given tract based on an understanding of population distribution and significant landmarks.

Comparisons to previous years should be interpreted with caution.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.",Census 2010: Tracts for San Francisco,[],Map,801.0,0.0070804126262938765

The 2014 Key Findings, Summary Report, and Methodology, including the survey instrument, can be found online at https://www.sfmta.com/about-sfmta/reports/travel-decision-survey-2014. 
On behalf of San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Corey, Canapary & Galanis (CC&G) undertook a Mode Share Survey within the City and County of San Francisco as well as the eight surrounding Bay Area counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Marin, Santa Clara, Napa, Sonoma and Solano.
The primary goals of this study were to:
? Assess percent mode share for travel in San Francisco for evaluation of the SFMTA Strategic Objective 2.3: Mode Share target of 50% non-private auto travel by FY2018 with a 95% confidence level and MOE +/- 5% or less.
? Evaluate the above statement based on the following parameters:  number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.
? Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.
? Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.
? Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.
The survey was conducted as a telephone study among with approximately 750 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, and Cantonese. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample. 
All three survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the ?weight? field when appropriate in your analysis. 
The survey period for this survey is as follows:
2014: October ? November 2014
A few questions in TDS 2014 were added after the survey began. In the report, responses that did not answer those questions were excluded from the analysis. The questions that were added late are noted in the TDS 2014 methodology survey instrument.
The margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error  is 3.5% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.

At the 95% confidence level is:
? n = 767 (Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.5%
? n = 384. Margin of error = +/- 4.95%
? n = 100. Margin of error = +/- 9.80%",Travel Decision Survey Data 2014,"['biking', 'bicycling', 'walking', 'survey', 'driving']",File or Document,731.0,0.006461649974807521

On behalf of San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Corey, Canapary & Galanis (CC&G) undertook a Mode Share Survey within the City and County of San Francisco as well as the eight surrounding Bay Area counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Marin, Santa Clara, Napa, Sonoma and Solano.
The primary goals of this study were to:
? Assess percent mode share for travel in San Francisco for evaluation of the SFMTA Strategic Objective 2.3: Mode Share target of 50% non-private auto travel by FY2018 with a 95% confidence level and MOE +/- 5% or less.
? Evaluate the above statement based on the following parameters:  number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.
? Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.
? Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.
? Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.
The survey was conducted as a telephone study among 762 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, and Cantonese. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample. 
All three survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the ?weight? field when appropriate in your analysis. 
The survey period for this survey is as follows:
2015: August ? October 2015
The margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error  is 3.5% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.

At the 95% confidence level is:
? n = 762(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.5%
? n = 382. Margin of error = +/- 4.95%
