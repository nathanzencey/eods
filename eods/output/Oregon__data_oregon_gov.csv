Some executive branch agencies have independent contracting authority for specific goods and services (e.g., Transportation, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Human Services, Fish and Wildlife, Parks and Recreation, Aviation, Economic and Community Development, Housing, Corrections, Veterans Affairs, Military, Education, and state agencies ""specifically authorized"" by any law outside the Code to ""enter into a contract"").
