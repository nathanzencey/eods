     Results are provided on a 1-5 scale. 1 is unacceptable, 2 is poor, 3 is acceptable, 4 is good, 5 is excellent. 
     Because the cards are physically mailed out there is a time delay between when a service request is closed and when the City is able to enter the survey results into our system. This data set refreshed daily. 
     Multiple results per 311 case are possible due to multiple people requesting the same service for the same location.

,"This data set contains asset ratings for the City's Roads, Bridges, and Street Lighting systems. This data is Citywide, and not granular to a specific piece of infrastructure. This is the same information that is reported to the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
Public Works has established a program to evaluate the condition of all pavements. The name of the program is the Street Distress Rating System (SDRS). This program rates all segments of pavement over a three year period. The program measures actual physical defects in the pavement system which can be observed and quantified through visual inspection of the roadway surface. Broad categories include cracking, patching, depression, and surface wear. The system calculates the Pavement Condition Index representing a value ranging from ""0"" to ""100"". The department's intent is to achieve and retain a system-wide average value of not less than ""60"". The value below 80 represents a system that needs repairs, and improvements. A rating of ""90"" to ""100"" would show an excellent condition, ""80"" to ""89"" good condition, ""70"" to ""79"" fair condition, and below ""70"", poor condition.
The condition of bridges is measured using the Federal Highway Administration Rating System. The Federal system uses a measurement scale that is based on a condition index ranging from zero for a failed bridge to 100 for a bridge in perfect condition.  The condition index is used to classify bridges and culverts in good or better condition (65 and 75 on up, respectively), fair condition (45 to 65) and substandard condition (less than 45).  It is the City?s policy to maintain, on average, at least 75 percent of its bridge system at a good or better condition level.  No more than 10 percent should be in the substandard condition.  Condition assessments are determined every other year.  All bridges are rated at least once every two years.
The condition of street lighting is measured using a system designed by the City. The system uses a measurement scale that is based on an assigned condition index to a streetlight of zero for failing or 100 for passing each measured factor and measures 16 different factors.  The condition index is used to classify street lighting in better condition ( 90 and up), good condition ( 80 to 89) and substandard condition (less than 80).  It is the City?s policy to maintain an overall average of at least 90 percent condition rating (better condition rating) for the entire street light system.  No more than 10 percent of the entire street lighting system should be below the better condition rating.  Condition assessments are determined every year.  Street lights are selected for condition assessments systematically by private contractor hired to assess and immediately repair all street lights inspected.  The plan is to have 100 percent of all street lights inspected, with corresponding repairs, every two years.","Road, Bridge, and Street Lighting Overall Condition","['street light rating', 'street rating', 'road rating', 'bridge rating', 'street lighting']",Dataset,192.0

Annual Audit Plan & Reports,"Annual Audit Plan
Programs and departments are selected for an audit in one of three ways.  The City Council as a body or the City Council?s Finance, Governance, and Ethics Committee may direct the city auditor to conduct a specific audit.  In addition, the city auditor has the authority and responsibility to initiate audits.
To develop an annual audit plan and select performance audits that can result in improved city operations and services to the public, the City Auditor?s Office considers a variety of factors including risks, Council priorities, KCStat, citizen surveys, past audits, and input and concerns from the City Council and city management.  We also ask the public for their ideas about potential audit topics.
The annual audit plan is subject to review and revision throughout the year.  Changes may be based on City Council directives, the city auditor?s discretion, staff changes, emerging issues, or unanticipated events.",2015 Audit Plan - City Auditor's Office,"['city operations', 'public', 'services', 'management', 'risks']",File or Document,190.0

,"This data set contains asset ratings for the City's Roads, Bridges, and Street Lighting systems. This data is Citywide, and not granular to a specific piece of infrastructure. This is the same information that is reported to the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
Public Works has established a program to evaluate the condition of all pavements. The name of the program is the Street Distress Rating System (SDRS). This program rates all segments of pavement over a three year period. The program measures actual physical defects in the pavement system which can be observed and quantified through visual inspection of the roadway surface. Broad categories include cracking, patching, depression, and surface wear. The system calculates the Pavement Condition Index representing a value ranging from ""0"" to ""100"". The department's intent is to achieve and retain a system-wide average value of not less than ""60"". The value below 80 represents a system that needs repairs, and improvements. A rating of ""90"" to ""100"" would show an excellent condition, ""80"" to ""89"" good condition, ""70"" to ""79"" fair condition, and below ""70"", poor condition.
The condition of bridges is measured using the Federal Highway Administration Rating System. The Federal system uses a measurement scale that is based on a condition index ranging from zero for a failed bridge to 100 for a bridge in perfect condition.  The condition index is used to classify bridges and culverts in good or better condition (65 and 75 on up, respectively), fair condition (45 to 65) and substandard condition (less than 45).  It is the City?s policy to maintain, on average, at least 75 percent of its bridge system at a good or better condition level.  No more than 10 percent should be in the substandard condition.  Condition assessments are determined every other year.  All bridges are rated at least once every two years.
The condition of street lighting is measured using a system designed by the City. The system uses a measurement scale that is based on an assigned condition index to a streetlight of zero for failing or 100 for passing each measured factor and measures 16 different factors.  The condition index is used to classify street lighting in better condition ( 90 and up), good condition ( 80 to 89) and substandard condition (less than 80).  It is the City?s policy to maintain an overall average of at least 90 percent condition rating (better condition rating) for the entire street light system.  No more than 10 percent of the entire street lighting system should be below the better condition rating.  Condition assessments are determined every year.  Street lights are selected for condition assessments systematically by private contractor hired to assess and immediately repair all street lights inspected.  The plan is to have 100 percent of all street lights inspected, with corresponding repairs, every two years.",Citywide Bridge Condition Rating,"['street light rating', 'street rating', 'road rating', 'bridge rating', 'street lighting']",Chart,133.0

,"This data set contains asset ratings for the City's Roads, Bridges, and Street Lighting systems. This data is Citywide, and not granular to a specific piece of infrastructure. This is the same information that is reported to the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
Public Works has established a program to evaluate the condition of all pavements. The name of the program is the Street Distress Rating System (SDRS). This program rates all segments of pavement over a three year period. The program measures actual physical defects in the pavement system which can be observed and quantified through visual inspection of the roadway surface. Broad categories include cracking, patching, depression, and surface wear. The system calculates the Pavement Condition Index representing a value ranging from ""0"" to ""100"". The department's intent is to achieve and retain a system-wide average value of not less than ""60"". The value below 80 represents a system that needs repairs, and improvements. A rating of ""90"" to ""100"" would show an excellent condition, ""80"" to ""89"" good condition, ""70"" to ""79"" fair condition, and below ""70"", poor condition.
The condition of bridges is measured using the Federal Highway Administration Rating System. The Federal system uses a measurement scale that is based on a condition index ranging from zero for a failed bridge to 100 for a bridge in perfect condition.  The condition index is used to classify bridges and culverts in good or better condition (65 and 75 on up, respectively), fair condition (45 to 65) and substandard condition (less than 45).  It is the City?s policy to maintain, on average, at least 75 percent of its bridge system at a good or better condition level.  No more than 10 percent should be in the substandard condition.  Condition assessments are determined every other year.  All bridges are rated at least once every two years.
The condition of street lighting is measured using a system designed by the City. The system uses a measurement scale that is based on an assigned condition index to a streetlight of zero for failing or 100 for passing each measured factor and measures 16 different factors.  The condition index is used to classify street lighting in better condition ( 90 and up), good condition ( 80 to 89) and substandard condition (less than 80).  It is the City?s policy to maintain an overall average of at least 90 percent condition rating (better condition rating) for the entire street light system.  No more than 10 percent of the entire street lighting system should be below the better condition rating.  Condition assessments are determined every year.  Street lights are selected for condition assessments systematically by private contractor hired to assess and immediately repair all street lights inspected.  The plan is to have 100 percent of all street lights inspected, with corresponding repairs, every two years.",Percent of Bridges in Good or Better Condition,"['street light rating', 'street rating', 'road rating', 'bridge rating', 'street lighting']",Chart,86.0

311,"This dataset contains results from 311 customer surveys. Someone who calls 311 for an issue is sent a small survey after the City believes it has addressed the issue. Not everyone is surveyed, due to some calls being anonymous, or not being able to locate the requester's mailing address. 
     Results are provided on a 1-5 scale. 1 is unacceptable, 2 is poor, 3 is acceptable, 4 is good, 5 is excellent. 
     Because the cards are physically mailed out there is a time delay between when a service request is closed and when the City is able to enter the survey results into our system. This data set refreshed daily. 
     Multiple results per 311 case are possible due to multiple people requesting the same service for the same location. For example, if 10 people ask 311 to have the City repaint a crosswalk at 12th and Grand Street, each of them will be mailed a survey and the results will show in this dataset.",311 Call Center Service Requests Survey Data (Public Works),"['action center survey data', '311 survey', 'survey data', 'action center', 'bdkc']",Filtered View,79.0
