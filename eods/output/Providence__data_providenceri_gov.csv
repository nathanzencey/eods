Series 1: 1940
-----------------------------------------------------------
Creator: Providence City Archives
------------------------------------------------------------
Language of materials: English
------------------------------------------------------
Repository: Providence City Archives
-------------------------------------------------------
Record Group Number: RG 131.3
--------------------------------------------------------
Scope and Content: The field cards were developed as a measure to accurately grade the value of a structure for tax purposes within the City of Providence.  The strength of the collection, contemporarily, concerns the sections under ?Land Valuation? on the verso of the digitized documents, particularly the status for which a building was zoned for (eg., house, apartment, industrial, or commercial structure, etc.).  This information helps distinguish the maximum amount of tenants a residential building can have within code. Other areas of interest include quality assessments from building materials to structural condition (eg., cost computation of values before and after deductions of existing conditions and improvements of a structure). 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Arrangement: The field cards are digitized and arranged in the Socrata database system accessed by address + plat/lot. 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Access to the collection: There are no restrictions to access. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Use of materials: The materials are within public domain. However, researchers are kindly asked to cite the Providence City Archives if reproduced.
