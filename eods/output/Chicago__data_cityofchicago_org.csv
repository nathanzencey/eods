Service Requests,"The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  
If a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of ""Duplicate (Open)"".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of ""Duplicate (Open)"".
Once the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read ?Completed? for the original request and ""Duplicate (Closed)"" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of ?Completed? when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a ?cave-in? or ?failed utility cut?, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor.

Public Safety,"Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR) codes are four digit codes that law enforcement agencies use to classify criminal incidents when taking individual reports. These codes are also used to aggregate types of cases for statistical purposes.  In Illinois, the Illinois State Police establish IUCR codes, but the agencies can add codes to suit their individual needs.  The Chicago Police Department currently uses more than 350 IUCR codes to classify criminal offenses, divided into ?Index? and ?Non-Index? offenses.  Index offenses are the offenses that are collected nation-wide by the Federal Bureaus of Investigation?s Uniform Crime Reports program to document crime trends over time (data released semi-annually), and include murder, criminal sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault & battery, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.
