Health and Human Services,"A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2015. A ""Y"" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.
Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.
The ?Morphine (Not Heroin)? values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as ?Morphine (not heroin).?  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.

Education,"This dataset contains the 2013 four-year cohort graduation rates by school. 
The Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) introduced the four-year cohort graduation rate with the graduating class of 2009. This approach was created when Connecticut and 49 other states signed an agreement with the National Governors? Association to develop a uniform system for tracking students.  The four-year cohort graduation rate is calculated by tracking an individual cohort, or group of students, from their initial entrance into Grade 9 through to graduation. The four-year cohort graduation rate represents the percentage of students who earn a standard high school diploma within four years. The calculation uses individual student-level data from the state's Public School Information System (PSIS) that school districts submitted and superintendents certified.
Notes: 
Double plus symbol (??) denotes not applicable; 
Asterisk symbol (*) denotes fewer than six in a cohort is suppressed;
Out-placed students are counted only in district graduation calculation;
Row percentages may not add to 100 percent because of rounding;
District graduation rates may not be the same as the average of the graduation rates of the number schools in that district because of out-placed students.

A mill is equal to $1.00 of tax for each $1,000 of assessment. To calculate the property tax, multiply the assessment of the property by the mill rate and divide by 1,000. For example, a property with a assessed value of $50,000 located in a municipality with a mill rate of 20 mills would have a property tax bill of $1,000 per year.
 
Local property tax mill rates have been set for individual Connecticut municipalities for fiscal year 2013-2014. These rates are based upon the 2012 grand list and are available below.

Government,"Priority Funding Areas are delineated based on conditions that exist at the Census Block level, which is the smallest geographical unit delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Census Blocks are statistical areas which in Connecticut are typically bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad lines. Generally, Census Blocks in denser urban communities are small in area, such as a block in a city that is bounded on all sides by streets. However, Census Blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, or irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads or streams. For example, a specific Census Block may be partially served by public water and/or sewer, and thus the entire block would appear to be served by these utilities. There were several instances during the public comment period where municipalities requested that certain Census Blocks be removed from this classification, and such requests were granted. Any limitations in the use of Census Blocks in this LGM should not be construed as influencing local land use and zoning decisions or municipal plans of conservation and development; nor should it create any expectation for future utility service where none currently exists.
Priority Funding Areas are classified by Census Blocks that include: ? Designation as an Urban Area or Urban Cluster in the 2010 Census Boundaries that intersect a ? mile buffer surrounding existing or planned mass-transit stations Existing or planned sewer service from an adopted Wastewater Facility Plan Existing or planned water service from an adopted Public Drinking Water Supply Plan Local bus service provided 7 days a week",Conservation and Development Policies Plan 2013-2018 Priority Funding Areas,"['gis', 'cdplan', 'opm']",Map,595.0,0.008090064856486329

According to research conducted by the College Board*, a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.
This dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate, which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the school divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the school as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the school is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.
The Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from school to school, the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid comparisons across schools. 
Note: The data are suppressed when there are too few test-takers to sufficiently protect privacy.

According to research conducted by the College Board*, a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.
This dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate, which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the district divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the district, as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the district is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.
The Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from district to district, the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid comparisons across districts. 
Note: The data are suppressed when there are too few test-takers to sufficiently protect privacy.

Government,"Connecticut Town Index is a 1:125,000-scale polygon feature-based layer that includes a polygon feature for every Connecticut town (municipality). There are 169 town polygon features in this layer. The corresponding town number and town name attributes uniquely identify town polygon features. Town number values are based on the Town Codes issued by the State of Connecticut, Office of the State Controller, which range from 1 to 169. As a historic note, the Connecticut Town Index layer was originally digitized in 1986 by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection using Esri ArcInfo 3 software installed on a mini computer. It was the first statewide GIS layer created by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. The data was in ArcInfo coverage format, Connecticut State Plane Coordinate System, North American Datum 1927, and map units feet.
Purpose: Connecticut Town Index is a general purpose index map of Connecticut towns that was compiled at 1:125,000 scale (1 inch equals approximately 2 miles). The layer is designed to be used to depict Connecticut towns at small scales or on small maps printed on regular size (8.5 x 11 inch) paper, for example. The Town Index layer does not accurately represent Connecticut town boundaries because it was digitized at 1:125,000 scale. Do not display, map or analyze the Town Index layer with information collected at larger scales. To depict more accurate 1:24,000-scale Connecticut town boundaries on a map, use the layer named Town, which is also published by the State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.",Town Boundary Index Map,"['map', 'gis', 'index', 'town']",Map,371.0,0.00504439338110324

A ""Y"" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.The ?Morphine (Not Heroin)? values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as ?Morphine (not heroin).?  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated. ?Any Opioid? ?

Health and Human Services,"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has prepared a public data set, the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber Public Use File (PUF), with information on prescription drugs prescribed by individual physicians and other health care providers and paid for under the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. The Part D Prescriber PUF is based on information from CMS?s Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, which contains Prescription Drug Event records submitted by Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans and by stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDP). The dataset identifies providers by their National Provider Identifier (NPI) and the specific prescriptions that were dispensed at their direction, listed by brand name (if applicable) and generic name. For each prescriber and drug, the dataset includes the total number of prescriptions that were dispensed, which include original prescriptions and any refills, and the total drug cost. The total drug cost includes the ingredient cost of the medication, dispensing fees, sales tax, and any applicable administration fees and is based on the amount paid by the Part D plan, Medicare beneficiary, government subsidies, and any other third-party payers.
Although the Part D Prescriber PUF has a wealth of information on payment and utilization for Medicare Part D prescriptions, the dataset has a number of limitations. Of particular importance is the fact that the data may not be representative of a physician?s entire practice or all of Medicare as it only includes information on beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (i.e., approximately two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries). In addition, the data are not intended to indicate the quality of care provided.
