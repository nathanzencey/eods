Economic Development,"Credit Card Hardship Program  mustn?t be confused with any of the various well known debt management plans offered through non-profit credit counseling agencies. Credit card issuers themselves offer these hardship programs internally. This Credit Card Hardship Program  include the ability to lower the interest rate, lower the minimum payment or reduce fees and penalties. These can be short-term, lasting six months to a year, or permanent, until the card balance is totally paid off.
If you own a credit-card, you?ll most likely have a hardship program. All creditors have them and they?re there for a reason because let?s face it financial hardships strike almost everyone at some point of time in their lives. Most credit card holders aren?t? aware of it because credit card issuers don?t like to advertise about them a lot.
