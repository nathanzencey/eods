This file was created primarily for State and Federal agency use.  The creation of this file goes back many years and involved several State and Federal agencies. This file was derived from a more detailed watershed file (Maryland's Third-Order Watershed).  The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file. The process used to create this file is consistent with the elevation contour information found on the US Geological Survey's 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and the Maryland Department of the Environment's watershed location and naming conventions.  This file is similar, but not identical, to the US Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC11) watershed file. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p.1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets.

There are three kinds of lead paint inspectors. They qualify in the following ways:
Visual Inspector (VI) - May perform Full or Modified Risk Reduction Inspections. This is done by a Dust Inspection or a Visual Inspection after unit has been prepared for inspection by an accredited lead paint abatement contractor. Visual Inspectors may also perform testing for Clearance.
Inspector Technician (IT) - May perform Lead Free Inspections. This is done by X-ray testing or paint chip analysis of all surfaces. Inspector Technicians may also perform testing for Clearance.
Risk Assessor (RA) - May perform all the functions of a VI and IT. Risk Assessors may also perform Lead Hazard Screenings and Risk Assessments. Risk Assessors may identify lead hazards and make recommendations from analysis of X-ray testing, paint chips, dust, soil, water and questionnaires. Risk Assessors may also perform testing for Clearance.

The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.

Energy and Environment,"The State conducted a detailed inventory of greenhouse gasses in 2006 and again in 2011.  Estimated actual emissions for those two years represent the results of these inventories.  
Projected emissions under a ""business as usual"" scenario were estimated based on the 2006 inventory, projected forward using a protocol set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The business as usual estimates were revised due to changes in the economy since the protocol was set out.  It is important to bear in mind that a BAU projected emissions inventory is a forecast that may, or may not, prove to be an entirely accurate predictor of future emissions. 
Annual actual emission estimates were calculated for the intervening years from 2006 through 2011 by utilizing three surrogates as indicators of emissions (energy, transportation and residential, commercial and industrial fuel combustion).

Transportation,"Annual Vehicle Miles of Travel (AVMT) represents the estimated number of miles driven on Maryland's public highways for a given year. There are two components used to estimate AVMT - traffic count data and highway mileage.
Traffic count data is summarized and reported as Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT).
AADTs are calculated from short-term (48-hour) traffic counts performed on all publicly maintained roads in Maryland (including county and municipal).  These counts are factored to account for seasonal variation in traffic patterns and represent an ?Average Day?. 
For planning purposes, AADT's are assigned to highway segments in order to provide a picture of traffic patterns is on the highway system on an average day.
Highway mileage statistics are complied annually based on mileage reports from the local jurisdictions and SHA and MDTA offices.  Any mileage changes  are field verified by SHA's data collections crews.   
AVMT is calculated by multiplying the AADT on a road segment by the segment length. Because AADT represents Daily traffic, the result is multiplied by 365 to represent Annual Vehicle Miles of Travel.

Energy and Environment,"Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. These data map hub and corridor elements within the green infrastructure. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - ""hubs"" and ""corridors."" 
Hubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres.
Corridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or ""most natural"" routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.",Maryland Green Infrastructure Hubs and Corridors,"['conservation', 'green infrastructure', 'landscape ecology']",Map,652.0,0.01346467587716581

MTA and partner state, local, and other agencies shall assume no liability for errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the information provided regardless of how caused; or any decision made or action taken or not taken by any person relying on any information or data furnished within. ***
This dataset assesses rail station potential for different forms of transit oriented development (TOD). A key driver of increased transit ridership in Maryland, TOD capitalizes on existing rapid transit infrastructure. The online tool focuses on the MTA?s existing MARC Commuter Rail, Metro Subway, and Central Light Rail lines and includes information specific to each station. 
The goal of this dataset is to give MTA planning staff, developers, local governments, and transit riders a picture of how each MTA rail station could attract TOD investment. In order to make this assessment, MTA staff gathered data on characteristics that are likely to influence TOD potential. The station-specific data is organized into 6 different categories referring to transit activity; station facilities; parking provision and utilization; bicycle and pedestrian access; and local zoning and land availability around each station. 
As a publicly shared resource, this dataset can be used by local communities to identify and prioritize area improvements in coordination with the MTA that can help attract investment around rail stations.
You can view an interactive version of this dataset at geodata.md.gov/tod.
 ** Ridership is calculated the following ways:
Metro Rail ridership is based on Metro gate exit counts.
Light Rail ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA.
MARC ridership is calculated using two (2) independent methods:
Monthly Line level ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA. This method of ridership calculation is used by the MTA for official reporting purposes to State level and Federal level reporting.
Station level ridership is estimated by using person counts completed by the third party vendor.

The period covered by these awards is fiscal years 2013-2015. The Network is a group of 39 statewide nonprofit agencies that provide foreclosure prevention assistance. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) provides financial support and training to these agencies. These counselors are the critical link in assisting individuals facing foreclosures, acting as a resource to negotiate reasonable terms with mortgage servicers, and advising citizens on the best actions to take to save their homes.

The performance measures are used to evaluate each State's performance and measure results in the Child Support Enforcement program. These measures emphasize paternity establishment, support order establishment, collection of current support, collection of arrearages, and cost effectiveness. The performance measures, except cost effectiveness which can only be measured annually, are calculated from data which is reported on federal form OCSE 157.  
CASES WITH SUPPORT ORDERS
This metric measures the proportion of IV-D cases with support orders established.
Equation:
Number of IV-D Cases with Support Orders divided by Total Number of IV-D Cases
IV-D Paternity Establishment Percentage:
This metric measures the proportion of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock is the total number of children in the IV-D caseload in the federal fiscal year born out of wedlock with paternity established or acknowledged divided by the total number of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock.  .
Equation:
Total # of Children in IV-D Caseload in the Federal Fiscal Year or, as of the end of the Fiscal Year who were born out of wedlock with Paternity Established or Acknowledged divided by Total # of Children in IV-D Caseload as of the end of the preceding Federal Fiscal Year who were Born Out of Wedlock
COLLECTIONS ON CURRENT SUPPORT
This measure focuses on the proportion of current support due that is collected on IV-D cases. 
Equation:
Total Dollars Collected for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year divided by Total Dollars Owed for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year
COLLECTIONS ON ARREARS
The measure assesses efforts to collect money from those cases with an arrearage due. 
The measure specifically counts paying cases, and not total arrears dollars collected.

Congress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program.
The Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan entitlement communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to non-entitlement counties, small cities and towns. Congress? allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program.
Maryland's Community Development Block Grant Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. The State receives an allocation from the Department of Housing and Urban Development each July.

Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.

Health and Human Services,"CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION
The performance measures are used to evaluate each State's performance and measure results in the Child Support Enforcement program. These measures emphasize paternity establishment, support order establishment, collection of current support, collection of arrearages, and cost effectiveness. The performance measures, except cost effectiveness which can only be measured annually, are calculated from data which is reported on federal form OCSE 157.  
CASES WITH SUPPORT ORDERS
This metric measures the proportion of IV-D cases with support orders established.
Equation:
Number of IV-D Cases with Support Orders divided by Total Number of IV-D Cases
IV-D Paternity Establishment Percentage:
This metric measures the proportion of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock is the total number of children in the IV-D caseload in the federal fiscal year born out of wedlock with paternity established or acknowledged divided by the total number of children in the IV-D caseload as of the end of the preceding FFY who were born out of wedlock.  .
Equation:
Total # of Children in IV-D Caseload in the Federal Fiscal Year or, as of the end of the Fiscal Year who were born out of wedlock with Paternity Established or Acknowledged divided by Total # of Children in IV-D Caseload as of the end of the preceding Federal Fiscal Year who were Born Out of Wedlock
COLLECTIONS ON CURRENT SUPPORT
This measure focuses on the proportion of current support due that is collected on IV-D cases. 
Equation:
Total Dollars Collected for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year divided by Total Dollars Owed for Current Support in IV-D Cases during the Federal Fiscal Year
COLLECTIONS ON ARREARS
The measure assesses efforts to collect money from those cases with an arrearage due. 
The measure specifically counts paying cases, and not total arrears dollars collected.
Equation:
Total number of IV-D cases paying toward arrears during the Federal Fiscal Year divided by Total number of IV-D cases with arrears due",Department of Human Resources(DHR): Child Support Enforcement Administration Performance Measures,"['support arrears', 'support collection', 'support order', 'paternity', 'child']",Dataset,192.0,0.0039650579270181525

Historic,"This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties is a research and documentation instrument that serves as an archive of information to further the understanding of the State's architectural -  archeological -  and cultural resources. To date -  the MIHP is comprised of nearly 90 - 000 resources -  composed of archaeological sites -  building -  structures -  objects and survey districts. A Maryland Inventory form provides a description of historic resource and discusses its history -  but the MIHP is not a regulatory instrument -  and the determination of a resource's historic significance is not a requirement for inclusion. Maryland State law provides elsewhere for mechanisms - separate from the MIHP - giving both the State and local jurisdictions the authority to regulate appropriately designated historic resources. The Maryland Inventory should not be confused with the National Register of Historic Places -  the Maryland Register of Historic Properties -  or local lists of locally designated historic resources -  although resources listed in all of the above categories are included in the Maryland Inventory.
